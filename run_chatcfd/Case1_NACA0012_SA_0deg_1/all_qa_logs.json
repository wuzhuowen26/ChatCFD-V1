    "reasoning_content": "Okay, so the user wants me to convert a JSON string into a Markdown format following specific rules. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, each top-level JSON key becomes a main heading with a #. The example given has \"Case_1\" as the top key, so that should be # Case_1. Then, the key-value pairs under Case_1 need to be unordered list items. So each of those keys like case_name, solver, etc., should be list items. \n\nWait, the third point says to maintain the original key-value hierarchy in list format. But in the provided JSON, the structure is only two levels deep: Case_1 is the top level, and all the other keys are under it. So I don't have to handle deeper nesting here. But maybe if there were nested objects, I would need to represent them with sub-lists. However, in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nLet me look at the JSON again. The Case_1 object has several key-value pairs. Each of these should be rendered as a list item. So in Markdown, under the # Case_1 heading, each key like case_name would be a bullet point with the key and its value. The format should be like `- **case_name**: Case1_NACA0012_SA_0deg`.\n\nI need to make sure that the keys are bolded and followed by a colon and the value. That way, it's clear and organized. Let me test this with the given example. For instance, the case_specific_description has a long value. I should keep that as a single line in the list item, even if it's long. Markdown handles that fine.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main heading is # Case_1, then each sub-key is a list item with the key in bold and the value after. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, ensuring that the JSON is parsed correctly and that all the keys under Case_1 are included. Also, making sure there are no syntax errors in the Markdown, like missing colons or incorrect bold formatting.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the JSON keys have underscores, like case_name. In the Markdown, those should be kept as-is unless specified otherwise, but the user didn't mention changing them, so underscores are fine. Also, the value for case_specific_description includes special characters like degrees symbols (°), hyphens, and parentheses. Markdown should handle those without issues as they are part of the text.\n\nI think that's all. The conversion should be straightforward here since the JSON structure is simple. Just map each top key to a heading and each sub-key to a list item with bold key and value.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14]. The specific\\nturbulence model equations are illustrated below.\\nThe fluctuation continuity equation is:\\nThe group average fluctuation velocity equation is:\\n( ) ( )\\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ 1 Turb Turb\\nj j i i j ij ij ij ij ij\\n∂ ∂ + + ∂ + − −\\n∂ ∂ ∂\\nσ σ σ σ u u u uu\\nWherein ˆ\\nu represents the group average fluctuation velocity and ˆ\\nσ the laminar stress\\ncorresponding to the fluctuation velocity after the group average, similar to the calculation\\nσ ˆ Turb\\nσ .

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's start by extracting the boundary conditions from the paper. The user mentioned the boundaries are inlet, outlet, and airfoil. The paper's Table 1 lists boundary conditions for U, p, nuTilda, and nut on these boundaries.\n\nFirst, check the OpenFOAM boundary names to correct any misspellings. The paper mentions \"inlet/outlet\" as a boundary. Since OpenFOAM doesn't use slashes, I need to split them into separate inlet and outlet boundaries. The front and back are labeled as \"empty\", which is a valid OpenFOAM boundary type.\n\nFor the airfoil (solid wall), the paper states U uses \"fixed-value\" which should be \"fixedValue\" in OpenFOAM. The p is \"zero gradient\", which is \"zeroGradient\". The nut uses \"nutLowReWallFunction\", but checking the list, the correct name is \"nutkWallFunction\". Wait, no—the paper says \"nutLowReWallFunction\" but looking at the OpenFOAM list, there's \"nutLowReWallFunction\"? Wait, the user provided a list that includes \"nutkWallFunction\", \"nutUSpaldingWallFunction\", etc. Hmm, maybe the correct one is \"nutkWallFunction\". Wait, the paper mentions \"nutLowReWallFunction\", but in the OpenFOAM list provided, there's \"nutLowReWallFunction\"? Let me check again. The user's list includes \"nutLowReWallFunction\" as a valid name. Wait, looking at the list: \"nutLowReWallFunction\" is present. So the correct spelling is \"nutLowReWallFunction\".\n\nFor inlet/outlet: U is \"freestreamVelocity\" which is valid. p is \"freestreamPressure\", correct. nuTilda is \"freestream\" which is valid. nut is \"freestream\", but in OpenFOAM, for nut, freestream might be \"nutkWallFunction\" or another. Wait, the paper's Table 1 says for inlet/outlet, nut uses \"freestream\", but in OpenFOAM, the correct boundary for nut in freestream is likely \"freestream\". Checking the list: \"freestream\" is a valid boundary condition. So \"freestream\" is correct.\n\nSo correcting the airfoil's nut from \"nutLowReWallFunction\" to \"nutLowReWallFunction\" (no change if it's already correct). The paper's \"fixed-value\" becomes \"fixedValue\", \"zero gradient\" becomes \"zeroGradient\".\n\nNow, structure the JSON with corrected boundaries: inlet and outlet are separate. Airfoil is the wall. Fields U, p, nuTilda, nut with their respective corrected BCs.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to simulate the NACA0012 airfoil case described in the paper using OpenFOAM-v2406. They provided specific boundary condition types in a JSON format and want the actual values converted from given flow parameters like Re, Ma, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the flow conditions from the paper. The paper mentions Mach number 0.15, Reynolds number 6e6 based on chord length, ambient temperature 300 K. The simulation is steady, incompressible, using the Spalart-Allmaras model. The grid is a structured C-grid with 897×257 cells and y+ <1.\n\nSince it's incompressible, Mach number isn't directly used in OpenFOAM's incompressible solvers, but we can derive velocity from Re. The chord length (c) is 1.0 (dimensionless), but for OpenFOAM, we need actual units. Let's assume the chord length is 1 meter for simplicity.\n\nReynolds number Re = ρUL/μ. Given Re=6e6, L=1m, and assuming air at 300 K, we can calculate the velocity. The kinematic viscosity ν = μ/ρ. For air at 300 K, ν ≈ 1.568e-5 m²/s (from standard tables). Rearranging Re = UL/ν → U = Re * ν / L = 6e6 * 1.568e-5 / 1 ≈ 94.08 m/s. So the freestream velocity is 94.08 m/s in the x-direction.\n\nThe Mach number is given as 0.15. Since Ma = U/a, where a is the speed of sound. At 300 K, a ≈ sqrt(γRT) = sqrt(1.4*287*300) ≈ 347.2 m/s. So U = 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s. Wait, but this contradicts the Re-based velocity. Hmm, the paper mentions Mach 0.15 but also Re=6e6. There must be a discrepancy here. Wait, maybe the paper uses a different reference velocity for Re. Let me check again.\n\nThe paper states: \"inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds number of 6×10^6 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature of 300 K.\" So Re is based on chord length (c=1m) and inflow velocity. So Re = (ρ U c)/μ. But in incompressible flow, ρ is constant. Let's recalculate using the given Ma and Re to find consistent parameters.\n\nWait, but in incompressible simulations, Mach number isn't directly a parameter. The paper might have used low-speed approximation. Let me reconcile Re and Ma. Ma = U/a. If Re = (U c)/ν, then U = Re ν / c. Given Re=6e6, c=1m, ν=1.568e-5 m²/s, U=6e6 * 1.568e-5 ≈ 94.08 m/s. Then Ma = 94.08 / 347.2 ≈ 0.271. But the paper says Ma=0.15. That's inconsistent. Maybe the paper used a different ν or temperature? Let me check the ambient temperature. The paper says 300 K. At 300 K, the speed of sound a is about 347 m/s. If Ma=0.15, then U=0.15*347≈52 m/s. But then Re= (52 * 1)/ν. If ν=1.568e-5, Re=52/1.568e-5≈3.31e6, but the paper says Re=6e6. Contradiction here. So perhaps the paper used a different reference length or there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the kinematic viscosity is adjusted to match both Re and Ma. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the simulation is incompressible but the Mach number is given for reference. Since it's low-speed (Ma=0.15), incompressible assumption holds. The Re is based on chord and inflow velocity. The user wants to set up the case in OpenFOAM, which for incompressible flow uses kinematic viscosity (nu). So given Re=6e6, chord=1m, U=94.08 m/s (from Re=U*L/ν), then ν=U*L/Re=94.08*1/6e6≈1.568e-5 m²/s, which matches the standard ν for air at 300K. So that's correct. The Mach number in the paper might be a typo or perhaps they adjusted the speed of sound. But for the OpenFOAM setup, the incompressible solver doesn't use Mach number. So we proceed with U=94.08 m/s, nu=1.568e-5 m²/s.\n\nNow, for the boundary conditions. The user provided a JSON structure with inlet, outlet, and airfoil boundaries. The types are fixedValue, zeroGradient, etc., but we need to assign the actual values.\n\nInlet and outlet have freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. For incompressible, pressure is kinematic pressure (p/rho). The freestreamPressure is usually zero (relative pressure), so p=0. The velocity is (94.08 0 0) m/s.\n\nFor the Spalart-Allmaras model, the nuTilda (the SA variable) at inlet is calculated. The freestream value for nuTilda is typically 3*nu to 5*nu. From OpenFOAM's SA model documentation, the freestream nuTilda is usually set to 3*nu. So nuTilda=3*1.568e-5≈4.704e-5 m²/s.\n\nThe nut (turbulent viscosity) at inlet is also needed. For SA model, nut=nuTilda. So nut=4.704e-5 m²/s.\n\nOn the airfoil (wall), U is fixedValue (0,0,0) (no-slip), p is zeroGradient. nuTilda is fixedValue 0 (as per SA wall treatment), and nut uses nutLowReWallFunction (automatically handles near-wall treatment).\n\nInitial conditions: Fields should be initialized with freestream values. So initial U is (94.08 0 0), p=0, nuTilda=4.704e-5, nut=4.704e-5.\n\nSo putting it all into the JSON structure:\n\nFor boundary conditions:\n\n- Inlet and outlet: U is freestreamVelocity (94.08 0 0), p is freestreamPressure 0, nuTilda and nut set to freestream values (4.704e-5).\n\n- Airfoil: U fixedValue (0 0 0), p zeroGradient, nuTilda fixedValue 0, nut nutLowReWallFunction.\n\nInitial fields:\n\nU: uniform (94.08 0 0)\n\np: uniform 0\n\nnuTilda: uniform 4.704e-5\n\nnut: uniform 4.704e-5\n\nSo the final JSON should reflect these values.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress.

Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°.

For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to set up an OpenFOAM case for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. The parameters are given, and specific files need to be generated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the case setup. The simulation is steady, incompressible, at 0° angle of attack, Mach 0.15, Re=6e6. The grid is a structured C-grid with 897x257 cells and y+ <1. The turbulence model is Spalart-Allmaras, using simpleFoam as the solver. The initial and boundary conditions are provided in JSON format.\n\nStarting with the system/controlDict. The application should be simpleFoam. The startTime is 0, endTime maybe 1000, with a writeInterval of 100. The writeFormat is ascii. The time format is steadyState since it's a steady simulation.\n\nNext, the 0/U file. The initial condition is uniform (94.08 0 0), which matches the Mach 0.15 (calculated velocity). The boundary conditions: inlet and outlet use freestreamVelocity with the same value. The airfoil has a fixedValue of (0 0 0) for no-slip. The front and back are empty because it's 2D.\n\nFor 0/p, initial is 0. The boundaries: inlet and outlet use freestreamPressure, zeroGradient on the airfoil, and empty for front/back.\n\n0/nuTilda: initial uniform 4.704e-05. Boundaries: inlet/outlet freestream, airfoil fixedValue 0, front/back empty. The nut file is similar, but the airfoil uses nutLowReWallFunction.\n\nIn constant/transportProperties, the transportModel is Newtonian, nu is 0.001568 m²/s (since Re=6e6, velocity=94.08 m/s, chord=1m, nu=U*L/Re = 94.08*1/6e6 ≈ 0.00001568, but wait, the given nuTilda initial is 4.704e-05. Wait, maybe the kinematic viscosity is different here. Wait, the user specified Re=6e6 based on chord. So nu = U*L/Re = (94.08 m/s * 1m)/6e6 = 94.08/6e6 ≈ 1.568e-5 m²/s. But in the transportProperties, the user might have set nu to this value. Let me check the given initial conditions. The initial nuTilda is 4.704e-05. Wait, Spalart-Allmaras uses nuTilda which is the modified viscosity. The actual nu (kinematic viscosity) should be calculated based on the problem's Re. Let me recalculate: Mach 0.15 at 300K, speed of sound is about 347 m/s, so velocity U = 0.15 * 347 ≈ 52.05 m/s. Wait, but the user's initial U is 94.08 m/s. Hmm, maybe the user has a different setup. But the transportProperties nu is the actual kinematic viscosity. Let me confirm. Re = U*L/nu. So nu = U*L/Re. Here, Re=6e6, L=1m, U=94.08 m/s. So nu = 94.08/(6e6) ≈ 1.568e-5 m²/s. So in transportProperties, nu should be 1.568e-5. But in the given example, the user's initial nuTilda is 4.704e-05. Since the SA model uses nuTilda as the working variable, which is different from the actual nu. But the transportProperties requires the actual kinematic viscosity. So in constant/transportProperties, nu is set to [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 1.568e-05. Let me check the user's JSON. The initial conditions for nuTilda are 4.704e-05. The user's initial nut is also 4.704e-05. But in SA model, nuTilda is the working variable, and nut is the turbulent viscosity. Wait, perhaps there's a confusion here. Wait, the Spalart-Allmaras model solves for nuTilda, which is a modified viscosity. The actual turbulent viscosity nut is computed from nuTilda. The initial value for nuTilda in the SA model is usually set to a small value, like 0.1*nu. But the user's initial nuTilda is 4.704e-05, which is higher than nu (1.568e-05). Hmm, maybe there's a scaling factor. Wait, the user's initial conditions for nuTilda and nut are both 4.704e-05. That might be correct if the initial guess for turbulent viscosity is set to some value. But the transportProperties should have the correct nu. Let me proceed with nu = 1.568e-05 in transportProperties.\n\nMoving on to system/fvSchemes. For steady-state, ddt terms are steadyState. Gradients Gauss linear. Divergence for U and nuTilda should be Gauss upwind or limited linear. Laplacian schemes Gauss linear corrected. Interpolation linear. SnGrad for wall is corrected. \n\nIn system/fvSolution, solvers for U (SIMPLE), p (GAMG), and nuTilda (smoothSolver). Relaxation factors for U and p. \n\nConstant/turbulenceProperties: RAS model is SpalartAllmaras, RASModel is on, turbulence is on, printCoeffs is on.\n\nNow, checking all the boundary conditions as per the user's JSON. Inlet and outlet have freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. Airfoil has fixedValue for U (0), zeroGradient for p, fixedValue 0 for nuTilda, and nutLowReWallFunction for nut. Front and back are empty.\n\nEach file's FoamFile header must include version, format, class, and object. For example, 0/U has class volVectorField, object U. \n\nNeed to ensure that in controlDict, the application is correctly set to simpleFoam. Also, in fvSolution, the SIMPLE algorithm is used with correct settings. The turbulenceProperties correctly specifies the RAS model.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned that the grid is already prepared, so no need for blockMeshDict. The case files should be structured correctly with all necessary directories: 0/, system/, constant/.\n\nDouble-checking all the initial and boundary conditions against the provided JSON. Especially making sure that inlet and outlet use freestream types, and the airfoil has the correct wall functions.\n\nFinally, ensuring that all files are in the correct OpenFOAM syntax, with proper FoamFile headers, and the values match the user's specifications.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14]. The specific\\nturbulence model equations are illustrated below.\\nThe fluctuation continuity equation is:\\nThe group average fluctuation velocity equation is:\\n( ) ( )\\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ 1 Turb Turb\\nj j i i j ij ij ij ij ij\\n∂ ∂ + + ∂ + − −\\n∂ ∂ ∂\\nσ σ σ σ u u u uu\\nWherein ˆ\\nu represents the group average fluctuation velocity and ˆ\\nσ the laminar stress\\ncorresponding to the fluctuation velocity after the group average, similar to the calculation\\nσ ˆ Turb\\nσ .

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident. This paper used the structured mesh of 897×257\\nfor subsequent calculation, with the airfoil wall y + <1.0.\\nFigure 1: Computational domain of NACA0012 airfoil\\nFigure 2: Computational domain grid\\nFigure 3: Computational grid near NACA0012 airfoil Figure\\nPage 6:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 4: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient\\nThe boundary conditions are inlet boundary, outlet boundary, solid wall boundary, and empty\\nboundary.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object.

Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to extract boundary conditions from a CFD paper and validate them against the OpenFOAM boundary name list, correcting any spelling mistakes but not changing the boundary types. They specified the fields U, p, nuTilda, and nut, and the boundaries inlet, outlet, and airfoil. \n\nFirst, looking at the paper excerpts, in Table 1 on Page 6, the boundary conditions are listed. For the airfoil (solid wall), the paper mentions \"no-slip adiabatic condition\", which in OpenFOAM typically translates to 'noSlip' for velocity. But checking the OpenFOAM list, 'noSlip' is indeed a valid boundary type. However, for the nut field, the paper uses 'nutLowReWallFunction', which matches the list. The p field here is 'zero gradient', so that's 'zeroGradient'. For U, 'fixedValue' is correct.\n\nFor inlet/outlet, the paper uses 'freestream velocity' for U, which corresponds to 'freestreamVelocity' in the list. The p field here is 'freestreamPressure', which is valid. The 'nuTilda' field uses 'fixed-value' with 'freestream', which should be 'fixedValue' with a freestream value. But in the OpenFOAM list, 'freestream' is a separate boundary condition. Wait, but in the paper's table, for inlet/outlet, 'U' is set to 'freestream velocity', which is 'freestreamVelocity' in OpenFOAM. Similarly, 'p' is 'freestreamPressure'. For 'nuTilda', it's 'fixed-value' with 'freestream', which might be 'fixedValue' with a freestream value. But the OpenFOAM list includes 'freestream' as a boundary type. Hmm, but looking at the fields, for 'nuTilda', the paper says 'fixed-value' and 'freestream', but the OpenFOAM list has 'freestream' as a possible boundary type. Wait, maybe the correct BC for 'nuTilda' at inlet/outlet is 'freestream' instead of 'fixedValue'. Wait, the paper's table says for inlet/outlet, 'nuTilda' is 'fixed-value' with 'freestream'. So perhaps the BC type is 'fixedValue' with a value of 'freestream'. But in OpenFOAM, 'freestream' is a BC type. Wait, I need to check. Looking at the OpenFOAM boundary list provided, there's 'freestreamVelocity' and 'freestreamPressure', but 'freestream' itself is also present. Wait, the user provided a list that includes 'freestreamVelocity' and 'freestreamPressure', but the paper's table lists 'freestream' for 'nuTilda'. Maybe in OpenFOAM, for 'nuTilda', the correct BC is 'freestream'? Or is it 'fixedValue' with a freestream value? The paper's table says 'fixed-value' under the 'nuTilda' column for inlet/outlet, and the value is 'freestream'. So perhaps the BC type is 'fixedValue' with a value of 'freestream'. However, checking the OpenFOAM list, there's a 'freestream' boundary type. But I need to validate the exact OpenFOAM BC names. The user provided a list that includes 'freestreamVelocity', 'freestreamPressure', and 'freestream' as separate entries. So for 'nuTilda', if the paper's BC is 'fixed-value' with 'freestream', perhaps in OpenFOAM, the correct BC is 'fixedValue' with a 'freestream' value. But in OpenFOAM, 'fixedValue' is a BC type where you specify a value. Alternatively, maybe the 'freestream' BC is a specific type that sets the value based on freestream conditions. But the user's instruction is to correct spelling only. The paper says 'fixed-value' which is OpenFOAM's 'fixedValue', so the BC type is 'fixedValue' with the value 'freestream'. However, the actual OpenFOAM BC for 'nuTilda' in the Spalart-Allmaras model might require a 'freestream' BC. But according to the user's provided list, 'freestream' is a valid BC name. Wait, the user's list includes 'freestream' as a boundary name. So perhaps for 'nuTilda' at inlet/outlet, the correct BC is 'freestream', not 'fixedValue'. But the paper's table says 'fixed-value' for 'nuTilda' and the value is 'freestream'. This is a bit confusing. The user's instruction is to correct spelling only. The paper's 'fixed-value' should be 'fixedValue' in OpenFOAM. So the BC type is 'fixedValue' and the value is 'freestream'. However, the OpenFOAM list has 'freestream' as a BC type. So maybe the paper's 'fixed-value' with 'freestream' is incorrect, and the correct BC type is 'freestream'. But the user says to only correct spelling, not change the boundary type. So if the paper's BC type is 'fixed-value', that's a spelling mistake. The correct BC name is 'fixedValue'. So for 'nuTilda' at inlet/outlet, BC is 'fixedValue' with value 'freestream'. But the value here is probably a specific numerical value, but the paper uses 'freestream' as the value. Alternatively, in OpenFOAM, 'freestream' might be a BC that automatically sets the value based on freestream conditions. But according to the user's instruction, we must only correct spelling. So the BC type for 'nuTilda' is 'fixedValue' as per the paper's 'fixed-value', and the value is 'freestream' (but maybe that's a typo and should be a numerical value). However, the user says not to change the boundary type except for spelling. So 'fixed-value' becomes 'fixedValue', and the value remains 'freestream'. But I need to check if 'freestream' is a valid value for 'fixedValue'. Alternatively, maybe the paper intended to use the 'freestream' BC type for 'nuTilda', but wrote 'fixed-value' by mistake. This is tricky. But the user's instruction is strict: correct only spelling, not change boundary type. So if the paper says 'fixed-value', correct to 'fixedValue'. The value part is not part of the BC type, so it's okay. Similarly, for 'nut' at inlet/outlet, the paper says 'freestream', which in OpenFOAM is 'freestream' BC. But looking at the OpenFOAM list, 'nut' might use 'nutLowReWallFunction' on the airfoil, but for inlet/outlet, the paper says 'freestream'. However, 'freestream' is a valid BC in the list. So for 'nut' at inlet/outlet, the BC is 'freestream'. But the paper's table says 'freestream' under 'nut' for inlet/outlet, which is already correct. So putting it all together:\n\nAirfoil (wall):\n- U: noSlip (since the paper says no-slip adiabatic, which is 'noSlip' in OpenFOAM)\n- p: zeroGradient (as per the paper's zero gradient)\n- nuTilda: fixedValue (the paper says fixed-value, corrected to fixedValue)\n- nut: nutLowReWallFunction (from the paper's entry)\n\nInlet/outlet:\n- U: freestreamVelocity (from the paper's freestream velocity)\n- p: freestreamPressure (from the paper's freestreamPressure)\n- nuTilda: fixedValue (paper's fixed-value corrected to fixedValue) with value freestream (but the BC type is fixedValue)\n- nut: freestream (paper's freestream, which is a valid BC)\n\nWait, but the user's OpenFOAM list includes 'freestream' as a BC type. So for 'nut' at inlet/outlet, the BC is 'freestream'. The paper's table says 'freestream' under 'nut' for inlet/outlet, which matches the OpenFOAM 'freestream' BC. So that's correct. For 'nuTilda', the paper's table says 'fixed-value' with 'freestream', so BC type is 'fixedValue', and the value is 'freestream' (which might be a field value). However, in OpenFOAM, 'fixedValue' requires a specific value, but the user's instruction is to only correct the BC type's spelling. So the BC type is 'fixedValue', and the value is as specified in the paper. Since the user only wants the BC types, not the values, perhaps the answer should just list the BC types. The user's example in the problem shows that for 'nut' on the airfoil, the BC is 'nutLowReWallFunction', which is from the paper's 'nutLowReWallFunction'. So, the final answer should have:\n\nFor each boundary (airfoil, inlet, outlet) and each field (U, p, nuTilda, nut), list the corrected BC types.\n\nSo the airfoil boundary:\n- U: noSlip (corrected from the paper's no-slip, which is 'noSlip' in OpenFOAM)\n- p: zeroGradient (paper says zero gradient)\n- nuTilda: fixedValue (paper's fixed-value)\n- nut: nutLowReWallFunction (matches the paper)\n\nInlet/outlet boundaries (inlet and outlet):\n- U: freestreamVelocity (paper's freestream velocity)\n- p: freestreamPressure (paper's freestreamPressure)\n- nuTilda: fixedValue (paper's fixed-value corrected)\n- nut: freestream (paper's freestream, which is a valid BC)\n\nThe user also mentioned that if there's a slash, like a/b, split into a and b. But in the paper's Table 1, the boundaries are Airfoil, Inlet/outlet, Front and back. However, the user wants to focus on inlet, outlet, airfoil. The 'Front and back' might be other boundaries, but the user says to ignore other boundaries. So the answer should only include inlet, outlet, airfoil.\n\nSo the final JSON would have entries for 'airfoil', 'inlet', and 'outlet' boundaries, each with their respective fields and corrected BC types.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object.

Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to simulate the NACA0012 airfoil at 0° angle of attack using OpenFOAM-v2406 with specific boundary conditions based on the paper. The provided JSON structure outlines the boundary types, and I mustn't change those. \n\nFirst, the flow conditions from the paper: Mach 0.15, Re=6e6 based on chord length, ambient temperature 300 K. The simulation is incompressible, so Mach number relates to velocity through the speed of sound. Speed of sound (a) is sqrt(γRT). For air, γ=1.4, R=287 J/kg·K. So a = sqrt(1.4*287*300) ≈ 347.2 m/s. Then velocity U = Ma * a = 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s. But wait, the paper uses incompressible flow, so maybe they use a reference velocity. Let me check the paper again.\n\nThe Reynolds number is Re=6e6, which is Re = (ρUL)/μ. Assuming standard air properties at 300 K: ρ=1.225 kg/m³, μ=1.7894e-5 kg/(m·s). Solving for U: U = (Re * μ)/(ρ * L). Chord length L=1m (dimensionless in the paper, but actual units matter for calculation). So U = (6e6 * 1.7894e-5)/(1.225 * 1) ≈ (107.364)/1.225 ≈ 87.63 m/s. Wait, this conflicts with the Mach number calculation. Hmm, the paper says Mach 0.15, but if U is 87.63 m/s, then Mach would be 87.63/347.2 ≈ 0.252. That's a discrepancy. Maybe the paper uses a different reference temperature or the Mach number is low enough that incompressible assumption holds despite the actual Mach. The user mentioned non-dimensional parameters, so perhaps they expect using Re and Ma to derive the necessary fields.\n\nBut since it's incompressible, maybe the pressure is calculated differently. The freestreamPressure in OpenFOAM for incompressible solvers is often set to zero gradient or a fixed value, but the paper's boundary conditions table (Table 1) shows inlet/outlet for p as freestreamPressure. The initial pressure field might be set to a reference value, maybe zero.\n\nFor nuTilda (Spalart-Allmaras variable), the inlet and outlet use fixedValue. The paper's boundary conditions table lists nuTilda as fixedValue for airfoil, inlet, and outlet. The value for nuTilda in S-A model is typically around 3 to 5 times the kinematic viscosity ν. ν = μ/ρ = 1.7894e-5 / 1.225 ≈ 1.46e-5 m²/s. So nuTilda could be set to 3*ν ≈ 4.38e-5, but the exact value might depend on the freestream turbulence. However, in many cases, a small value like 0.1*ν is used for smooth flows. Wait, the paper's Table 1 says nuTilda is fixedValue for airfoil, inlet, and outlet. The S-A model's nuTilda at the inlet is usually set to a fraction of the kinematic viscosity. According to the Spalart-Allmaras model, the freestream value for nuTilda is typically set between 0.1ν to 10ν. Let me check the OpenFOAM documentation. For the S-A model, the freestream nuTilda is often set to 3ν or similar. Let's compute ν = 1.7894e-5 / 1.225 ≈ 1.46e-5 m²/s. So 3ν ≈ 4.38e-5. But the exact value might be specified in the paper. Looking back, the paper mentions the S-A model but doesn't specify the nuTilda values. So perhaps the user expects using a standard value. Alternatively, since the paper uses Re=6e6, and the chord is 1m, the nuTilda could be calculated based on that. Alternatively, in OpenFOAM's SA model, the initial and boundary conditions for nuTilda are often set to 0.1 or similar, but I need to convert properly.\n\nWait, the user wants to convert non-dimensional parameters to field values. The key parameters are Re=6e6, Ma=0.15, T=300K. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the kinematic viscosity ν = μ/ρ. But given Re=ρUL/μ, rearranged as ν = UL/Re. Given U is to be determined from Ma and speed of sound. But for incompressible, maybe Ma isn't directly used, but the velocity is derived from Re. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the paper states Mach=0.15 and Re=6e6. Since it's incompressible, the Mach number is low, so the actual velocity is U=Ma*a. But Re is also given. Let's check if these are consistent. Using U=Ma*a=0.15*347.2≈52.08 m/s. Then Re= (U*L)/ν → ν= (U*L)/Re = (52.08 * 1)/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s. Then μ=ν*ρ=8.68e-6 *1.225≈1.063e-5 kg/(m·s). But standard air at 300K has μ≈1.846e-5 kg/(m·s). This inconsistency suggests that the paper might have defined Re based on a different velocity or length. Alternatively, perhaps the chord length isn't 1m in actual units. Wait, in the paper, the chord length is dimensionless c=1.0, but in reality, it's scaled. Wait, the user is setting up the case, so perhaps the actual chord length is 1m, and the Re is based on that. So to reconcile Ma=0.15 and Re=6e6, we need to find U and ν such that both are satisfied. But that's impossible unless the temperature is adjusted. Alternatively, the paper might have a typo, but the user wants to proceed with the given parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the simulation uses the incompressible solver, so Mach number isn't directly used in the setup, but the velocity is derived from Re. Let's proceed with Re=6e6, chord length L=1m, and standard air properties at 300K. Then U = Re * ν / L. ν for air at 300K is 1.568e-5 m²/s (calculating using μ=1.846e-5 kg/(m·s) and ρ=1.225 kg/m³ gives ν=1.846e-5 /1.225≈1.507e-5 m²/s). Then U=6e6 *1.507e-5 /1≈ 90.42 m/s. But this gives a Mach number of 90.42/347.2≈0.26, which is higher than the paper's 0.15. This inconsistency needs to be resolved. \n\nWait, the paper says \"low-speed flow around NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\". So the Mach number is 0.15, which would correspond to U=0.15*347.2≈52.08 m/s. Then Re= (U*L)/ν → ν= (52.08 *1)/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s. But this ν is lower than standard air's ν at 300K. To achieve this ν, the temperature would have to be higher, or the pressure different. Alternatively, the problem might be using a different reference length or velocity. \n\nThis is getting complicated. The user wants to set up the case with the given parameters. Let's proceed by calculating the necessary fields based on the provided Re and Ma. Assuming ideal gas, but since it's incompressible, perhaps the density is constant. Let's assume standard sea-level conditions: T=300K, p=101325 Pa, ρ=1.225 kg/m³, μ=1.7894e-5 kg/(m·s), ν=1.46e-5 m²/s. Then Re=6e6 = (U * L)/ν → U= (Re * ν)/L = (6e6 *1.46e-5)/1 ≈ 87.6 m/s. Mach number would be U/a =87.6/347.2≈0.252, which conflicts with the paper's Mach 0.15. So there's a discrepancy here. \n\nBut the user says the flow condition might be given as non-dimensional parameters, and we need to convert these to field values. The key is to define U, p, nuTilda, nut (turbulent viscosity) based on Re=6e6, Ma=0.15, and T=300K. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate speed of sound a= sqrt(γRT) = sqrt(1.4*287*300)≈347.2 m/s. Then U=Ma*a=0.15*347.2≈52.08 m/s. Re=6e6 = (ρ U L)/μ → solve for μ= (ρ U L)/Re. Assuming L=1m (chord length), ρ=1.225 kg/m³, then μ= (1.225 *52.08 *1)/6e6 ≈ (63.83)/6e6≈1.064e-5 kg/(m·s). Then ν=μ/ρ≈1.064e-5/1.225≈8.68e-6 m²/s. This ν is lower than standard air, but perhaps the simulation uses these values. \n\nNow, for the Spalart-Allmaras model, the turbulent viscosity ν_t is computed from nuTilda. The freestream value for nuTilda is typically set between 3ν to 5ν. So nuTilda_inlet = 3ν ≈3*8.68e-6≈2.6e-5. The nut (turbulent viscosity) in OpenFOAM for SA model is computed as nut = nuTilda * fv1, where fv1 is a function of nuTilda/ν. In the freestream, fv1 approaches 1 when nuTilda/ν is small, so nut ≈ nuTilda. Therefore, nut_inlet would be approximately 2.6e-5. But according to the boundary conditions provided, nut at inlet/outlet is set to 'freestream', which in OpenFOAM usually takes the value specified in the turbulenceProperties dictionary. Alternatively, in the boundary conditions, 'freestream' might require a value. Wait, the user's JSON specifies \"nut\": \"freestream\" for inlet and outlet. In OpenFOAM, 'freestream' is a mixed BC that uses a freestream value and a valueFraction. But perhaps in this context, the user expects 'freestream' to be a fixedValue with the freestream nut value. However, the exact setup might require specifying the freestreamValue for nut. But the user's instruction says to convert the flow parameters to field values. The nut freestream value can be calculated based on the turbulence model. For the S-A model, in the freestream, the turbulent viscosity is typically a small fraction of the molecular viscosity. But in this case, since the flow is low-speed and the paper doesn't specify turbulence intensity, perhaps nut is set to a small value. Alternatively, using the S-A model's recommendation, nuTilda is set to 3ν, and nut is approximately equal to nuTilda in the freestream. So nut_freestream = nuTilda_freestream ≈3ν ≈2.6e-5. \n\nFor initial conditions, the fields U, p, nuTilda, nut need to be initialized. The initial U would be the freestream velocity (52.08 m/s) in the inlet direction. The pressure is typically initialized to zero in incompressible solvers, but might be set to a reference value. The paper's boundary conditions for p are 'freestreamPressure' at inlet/outlet, which in OpenFOAM is usually a fixedValue with a value of 0 (relative pressure). So initial p could be 0. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Airfoil (wall) boundaries: U is noSlip (0 velocity), p zeroGradient, nuTilda fixedValue (0? Wait, no. For walls in SA model, nuTilda is typically set to 0. But according to the paper's Table 1, nuTilda is fixedValue for airfoil. So what value? The SA model requires nuTilda=0 at walls. So airfoil's nuTilda should be fixedValue 0. \n\nWait, checking the paper's Table 1: Airfoil's nuTilda is fixedValue. The S-A model's wall boundary condition for nuTilda is typically zero, so fixedValue 0. Similarly, nut at the airfoil uses nutLowReWallFunction, which enforces nut=0 at the wall. \n\nInlet and Outlet: U is freestreamVelocity (52.08 m/s). For incompressible, direction matters. Assuming the inlet is a velocity inlet with U (52.08, 0, 0) m/s. Pressure is freestreamPressure, which is 0 (relative). nuTilda is fixedValue with 3ν ≈2.6e-5. nut is freestream, which would be the same as nuTilda (since in freestream, nut ≈ nuTilda). \n\nInitial conditions:\n- U: uniform (52.08 0 0)\n- p: uniform 0\n- nuTilda: uniform 2.6e-5\n- nut: uniform 2.6e-5\n\nBut wait, according to the SA model, the initial and boundary conditions for nuTilda should be set properly. If the freestream nuTilda is 3ν, then that's the value. \n\nSo compiling all this into the JSON structure provided by the user, the final answer should have:\n\n- Airfoil BCs: U=noSlip (0), p=zeroGradient, nuTilda=fixedValue 0, nut=nutLowReWallFunction (which in OpenFOAM doesn't require a value, just the type).\n\n- Inlet and Outlet: U=freestreamVelocity (52.08 m/s), p=freestreamPressure (0), nuTilda=fixedValue 2.6e-5, nut=freestream (which in OpenFOAM may need a value, but the user's JSON specifies the type as 'freestream', so perhaps the value is set in the turbulenceProperties. However, the user wants field values converted from parameters, so the 'freestream' for nut would have a value of 2.6e-5).\n\nBut the user's JSON specifies the types, not the values. Wait, the user says: \"Convert these flow parameters to the field values.\" So the actual numerical values need to be filled in for each boundary's fields. For example, 'freestreamVelocity' would have a value of (52.08 0 0), 'fixedValue' for nuTilda would have 2.6e-5 at inlet and outlet, and 0 at the airfoil. The 'freestreamPressure' is 0. \n\nSo the final JSON would look like this, with numerical values based on the calculations.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2.

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident. This paper used the structured mesh of 897×257\\nfor subsequent calculation, with the airfoil wall y + <1.0.\\nFigure 1: Computational domain of NACA0012 airfoil\\nFigure 2: Computational domain grid\\nFigure 3: Computational grid near NACA0012 airfoil Figure\\nPage 6:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 4: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient\\nThe boundary conditions are inlet boundary, outlet boundary, solid wall boundary, and empty\\nboundary.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results.

Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to set up an OpenFOAM case for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil at 0° angle of attack using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. They provided specific boundary conditions and initial settings in JSON format. The goal is to generate all necessary case files without the blockMeshDict since the mesh is already prepared.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure of an OpenFOAM case. The main directories are 0/, system/, and constant/. The 0/ directory contains initial and boundary condition files for each field (U, p, nuTilda, nut). The system/ directory includes controlDict, fvSchemes, and fvSolution. The constant/ directory has transportProperties and turbulenceProperties.\n\nStarting with system/controlDict: The application should be simpleFoam for steady incompressible flow. The user specified OpenFOAM-v2406, so I'll set the version accordingly. The startTime is 0, endTime 1000, writeInterval 100, and deltaT 1. The writeFormat is ascii. I'll make sure the application entry is correct.\n\nNext, 0/U: The initial velocity is uniform (52.08, 0, 0). The boundary conditions for the airfoil (wall) are noSlip for U, zeroGradient for p, fixedValue 0 for nuTilda, and nutLowReWallFunction for nut. Inlet and outlet use freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. The front and back (empty) boundaries are set to empty. I'll apply these settings to each field file.\n\nFor 0/p, the initial value is 0, with similar boundary conditions. The nuTilda file initializes to 2.6e-5, with fixedValue at inlet/outlet and 0 on the airfoil. The nut file uses uniform 2.6e-5 initially, with freestream at inlet/outlet and nutLowReWallFunction on the airfoil.\n\nIn constant/transportProperties, since it's incompressible, the kinematic viscosity (nu) is calculated using nu = mu/rho. Given Re=6e6, chord length c=1m, and velocity U=52.08 m/s, nu = (U*c)/Re = 52.08/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s. But wait, the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-5. Maybe they set nu differently. Let me check the JSON: the initial nuTilda and nut are 2.6e-5. The transportProperties should have nu [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 2.6e-05. Wait, no—nu is the kinematic viscosity. The SA model uses nuTilda, which is similar to the modified viscosity. But in the transportProperties, nu is the laminar kinematic viscosity. From the paper, the Reynolds number is based on chord length (c=1m), Mach 0.15, so U=0.15*340≈51 m/s. But the user's JSON specifies U=52.08, which gives Re= (52.08 *1)/ (nu) =6e6 → nu=52.08/6e6≈8.68e-6. But in their initial conditions, nuTilda is 2.6e-5. That might be an error. However, the user's JSON says initial nuTilda is 2.6e-5. Maybe they intended that. So in transportProperties, set nu to the laminar viscosity, which would be 8.68e-6. But the user's JSON initial has nuTilda as 2.6e-5. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the user provided the correct nu value. Alternatively, perhaps the nu in transportProperties should match the initial nuTilda. But according to the SA model, nuTilda is a modified viscosity. The initial value for nuTilda is typically set to a fraction of the laminar viscosity. Hmm, but the user's initial conditions specify nuTilda as 2.6e-5. Maybe I should follow the user's JSON exactly, even if there's a discrepancy. Since the user provided specific initial values, I'll set transportProperties' nu to match the initial conditions. Wait no—nu in transportProperties is the laminar viscosity, which is separate from nuTilda. The SA model uses nuTilda as the working variable. So nu in transportProperties should be the actual kinematic viscosity (8.68e-6), while nuTilda's initial value is 2.6e-5. But the user's JSON specifies initial nuTilda as 2.6e-5. Maybe they intended to set nuTilda to 3*nu (common practice) which would be 2.6e-5 if nu is 8.68e-6. 8.68e-6 *3 ≈ 2.6e-5. That makes sense. So in transportProperties, nu is 8.68e-6. But the user's JSON has nuTilda initial as 2.6e-5, which aligns with 3*nu. Therefore, in constant/transportProperties, set nu to 8.68e-6. However, the user's JSON doesn't specify this. Wait, the user's JSON has initial nuTilda as 2.6e-5 and nut as 2.6e-5. But in OpenFOAM, nut is the turbulent viscosity, which for SA model is calculated from nuTilda. The initial nut might be set to zero, but the user has it as 2.6e-5. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I need to follow their JSON. Let me proceed with the files as per the user's specifications.\n\nIn constant/turbulenceProperties, the simulationType is RAS, RASModel is SpalartAllmaras, and turbulence is on, printCoeffs is on.\n\nFor system/fvSchemes, use Gauss linear for grad, div, laplacian. Interpolation schemes as linear. snGrad corrected for the wall.\n\nIn system/fvSolution, the solvers for U, p, nuTilda. SIMPLE algorithm with relaxation factors. Residual controls.\n\nNow, cross-checking all boundary conditions. The airfoil (wall) has U as noSlip, p zeroGradient, nuTilda fixedValue 0, nut nutLowReWallFunction. Inlet and outlet for U and p are freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. For nuTilda and nut, inlet/outlet have fixedValue 2.6e-5 (nuTilda) and freestream 2.6e-5 (nut). Front and back are empty.\n\nEach file's FoamFile header must be correct. For example, 0/U has class volVectorField, object U. Similarly for other fields.\n\nMake sure all files are structured correctly, no typos in boundary names (airfoil, inlet, outlet, front, back). The user's JSON mentions front and back as empty, so those boundaries should have type empty.\n\nAlso, check that in system/controlDict, the application is simpleFoam. The user emphasized this.\n\nFinally, ensure that all entries in the JSON are accurately translated into the respective files. For example, the initial conditions for U, p, nuTilda, nut are uniform values as specified. Boundary types match the JSON (noSlip, freestreamVelocity, etc.).\n\nPotential issues: The user's initial nut is set to 2.6e-5, but for the SA model, the nut is calculated from nuTilda. However, in OpenFOAM, the initial value for nut might be computed automatically. But since the user specified it, I'll set it as per their instruction.\n\nI think that covers all necessary files and settings. Now, structure each file's content according to OpenFOAM syntax and the user's requirements.\n",
