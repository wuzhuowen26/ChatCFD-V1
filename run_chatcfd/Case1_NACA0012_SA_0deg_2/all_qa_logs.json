    "reasoning_content": "Okay, so the user wants me to convert a JSON string into a Markdown format following specific rules. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, each top-level JSON key becomes a main heading with a #. The example given has \"Case_1\" as the top key, so that should be # Case_1. Then, the key-value pairs under Case_1 need to be unordered list items. So each of those keys like case_name, solver, etc., should be list items. \n\nWait, the third point says to maintain the original key-value hierarchy in list format. But in the provided JSON, the structure is only two levels deep: Case_1 is the top level, and all the other keys are under it. So I don't have to handle deeper nesting here. But maybe if there were nested objects, I would need to represent them with sub-lists. However, in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nLet me look at the JSON again. The Case_1 object has several key-value pairs. Each of these should be rendered as a list item. So in Markdown, under the # Case_1 heading, each key like case_name would be a bullet point with the key and its value. The format should be like `- **case_name**: Case1_NACA0012_SA_0deg`.\n\nI need to make sure that the keys are bolded and followed by a colon and the value. That way, it's clear and organized. Let me test this with the given example. For instance, the case_specific_description has a long value. I should keep that as a single line in the list item, even if it's long. Markdown handles that fine.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main heading is # Case_1, then each sub-key is a list item with the key in bold and the value after. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, ensuring that the JSON is parsed correctly and that all the keys under Case_1 are included. Also, making sure there are no syntax errors in the Markdown, like missing colons or incorrect bold formatting.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the JSON keys have underscores, like case_name. In the Markdown, those should be kept as-is unless specified otherwise, but the user didn't mention changing them, so underscores are fine. Also, the value for case_specific_description includes special characters like degrees symbols (°), hyphens, and parentheses. Markdown should handle those without issues as they are part of the text.\n\nI think that's all. The conversion should be straightforward here since the JSON structure is simple. Just map each top key to a heading and each sub-key to a list item with bold key and value.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14]. The specific\\nturbulence model equations are illustrated below.\\nThe fluctuation continuity equation is:\\nThe group average fluctuation velocity equation is:\\n( ) ( )\\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ 1 Turb Turb\\nj j i i j ij ij ij ij ij\\n∂ ∂ + + ∂ + − −\\n∂ ∂ ∂\\nσ σ σ σ u u u uu\\nWherein ˆ\\nu represents the group average fluctuation velocity and ˆ\\nσ the laminar stress\\ncorresponding to the fluctuation velocity after the group average, similar to the calculation\\nσ ˆ Turb\\nσ .

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's start by extracting the boundary conditions from the paper. The user mentioned the boundaries are inlet, outlet, and airfoil. The paper's Table 1 lists boundary conditions for U, p, nuTilda, and nut on these boundaries.\n\nFirst, check the OpenFOAM boundary names to correct any misspellings. The paper mentions \"inlet/outlet\" as a boundary. Since OpenFOAM doesn't use slashes, I need to split them into separate inlet and outlet boundaries. The front and back are labeled as \"empty\", which is a valid OpenFOAM boundary type.\n\nFor the airfoil (solid wall), the paper states U uses \"fixed-value\" which should be \"fixedValue\" in OpenFOAM. The p is \"zero gradient\", which is \"zeroGradient\". The nut uses \"nutLowReWallFunction\", but checking the list, the correct name is \"nutkWallFunction\". Wait, no—the paper says \"nutLowReWallFunction\" but looking at the OpenFOAM list, there's \"nutLowReWallFunction\"? Wait, the user provided a list that includes \"nutkWallFunction\", \"nutUSpaldingWallFunction\", etc. Hmm, maybe the correct one is \"nutkWallFunction\". Wait, the paper mentions \"nutLowReWallFunction\", but in the OpenFOAM list provided, there's \"nutLowReWallFunction\"? Let me check again. The user's list includes \"nutLowReWallFunction\" as a valid name. Wait, looking at the list: \"nutLowReWallFunction\" is present. So the correct spelling is \"nutLowReWallFunction\".\n\nFor inlet/outlet: U is \"freestreamVelocity\" which is valid. p is \"freestreamPressure\", correct. nuTilda is \"freestream\" which is valid. nut is \"freestream\", but in OpenFOAM, for nut, freestream might be \"nutkWallFunction\" or another. Wait, the paper's Table 1 says for inlet/outlet, nut uses \"freestream\", but in OpenFOAM, the correct boundary for nut in freestream is likely \"freestream\". Checking the list: \"freestream\" is a valid boundary condition. So \"freestream\" is correct.\n\nSo correcting the airfoil's nut from \"nutLowReWallFunction\" to \"nutLowReWallFunction\" (no change if it's already correct). The paper's \"fixed-value\" becomes \"fixedValue\", \"zero gradient\" becomes \"zeroGradient\".\n\nNow, structure the JSON with corrected boundaries: inlet and outlet are separate. Airfoil is the wall. Fields U, p, nuTilda, nut with their respective corrected BCs.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to simulate the NACA0012 airfoil case described in the paper using OpenFOAM-v2406. They provided specific boundary condition types in a JSON format and want the actual values converted from given flow parameters like Re, Ma, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the flow conditions from the paper. The paper mentions Mach number 0.15, Reynolds number 6e6 based on chord length, ambient temperature 300 K. The simulation is steady, incompressible, using the Spalart-Allmaras model. The grid is a structured C-grid with 897×257 cells and y+ <1.\n\nSince it's incompressible, Mach number isn't directly used in OpenFOAM's incompressible solvers, but we can derive velocity from Re. The chord length (c) is 1.0 (dimensionless), but for OpenFOAM, we need actual units. Let's assume the chord length is 1 meter for simplicity.\n\nReynolds number Re = ρUL/μ. Given Re=6e6, L=1m, and assuming air at 300 K, we can calculate the velocity. The kinematic viscosity ν = μ/ρ. For air at 300 K, ν ≈ 1.568e-5 m²/s (from standard tables). Rearranging Re = UL/ν → U = Re * ν / L = 6e6 * 1.568e-5 / 1 ≈ 94.08 m/s. So the freestream velocity is 94.08 m/s in the x-direction.\n\nThe Mach number is given as 0.15. Since Ma = U/a, where a is the speed of sound. At 300 K, a ≈ sqrt(γRT) = sqrt(1.4*287*300) ≈ 347.2 m/s. So U = 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s. Wait, but this contradicts the Re-based velocity. Hmm, the paper mentions Mach 0.15 but also Re=6e6. There must be a discrepancy here. Wait, maybe the paper uses a different reference velocity for Re. Let me check again.\n\nThe paper states: \"inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds number of 6×10^6 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature of 300 K.\" So Re is based on chord length (c=1m) and inflow velocity. So Re = (ρ U c)/μ. But in incompressible flow, ρ is constant. Let's recalculate using the given Ma and Re to find consistent parameters.\n\nWait, but in incompressible simulations, Mach number isn't directly a parameter. The paper might have used low-speed approximation. Let me reconcile Re and Ma. Ma = U/a. If Re = (U c)/ν, then U = Re ν / c. Given Re=6e6, c=1m, ν=1.568e-5 m²/s, U=6e6 * 1.568e-5 ≈ 94.08 m/s. Then Ma = 94.08 / 347.2 ≈ 0.271. But the paper says Ma=0.15. That's inconsistent. Maybe the paper used a different ν or temperature? Let me check the ambient temperature. The paper says 300 K. At 300 K, the speed of sound a is about 347 m/s. If Ma=0.15, then U=0.15*347≈52 m/s. But then Re= (52 * 1)/ν. If ν=1.568e-5, Re=52/1.568e-5≈3.31e6, but the paper says Re=6e6. Contradiction here. So perhaps the paper used a different reference length or there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the kinematic viscosity is adjusted to match both Re and Ma. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the simulation is incompressible but the Mach number is given for reference. Since it's low-speed (Ma=0.15), incompressible assumption holds. The Re is based on chord and inflow velocity. The user wants to set up the case in OpenFOAM, which for incompressible flow uses kinematic viscosity (nu). So given Re=6e6, chord=1m, U=94.08 m/s (from Re=U*L/ν), then ν=U*L/Re=94.08*1/6e6≈1.568e-5 m²/s, which matches the standard ν for air at 300K. So that's correct. The Mach number in the paper might be a typo or perhaps they adjusted the speed of sound. But for the OpenFOAM setup, the incompressible solver doesn't use Mach number. So we proceed with U=94.08 m/s, nu=1.568e-5 m²/s.\n\nNow, for the boundary conditions. The user provided a JSON structure with inlet, outlet, and airfoil boundaries. The types are fixedValue, zeroGradient, etc., but we need to assign the actual values.\n\nInlet and outlet have freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. For incompressible, pressure is kinematic pressure (p/rho). The freestreamPressure is usually zero (relative pressure), so p=0. The velocity is (94.08 0 0) m/s.\n\nFor the Spalart-Allmaras model, the nuTilda (the SA variable) at inlet is calculated. The freestream value for nuTilda is typically 3*nu to 5*nu. From OpenFOAM's SA model documentation, the freestream nuTilda is usually set to 3*nu. So nuTilda=3*1.568e-5≈4.704e-5 m²/s.\n\nThe nut (turbulent viscosity) at inlet is also needed. For SA model, nut=nuTilda. So nut=4.704e-5 m²/s.\n\nOn the airfoil (wall), U is fixedValue (0,0,0) (no-slip), p is zeroGradient. nuTilda is fixedValue 0 (as per SA wall treatment), and nut uses nutLowReWallFunction (automatically handles near-wall treatment).\n\nInitial conditions: Fields should be initialized with freestream values. So initial U is (94.08 0 0), p=0, nuTilda=4.704e-5, nut=4.704e-5.\n\nSo putting it all into the JSON structure:\n\nFor boundary conditions:\n\n- Inlet and outlet: U is freestreamVelocity (94.08 0 0), p is freestreamPressure 0, nuTilda and nut set to freestream values (4.704e-5).\n\n- Airfoil: U fixedValue (0 0 0), p zeroGradient, nuTilda fixedValue 0, nut nutLowReWallFunction.\n\nInitial fields:\n\nU: uniform (94.08 0 0)\n\np: uniform 0\n\nnuTilda: uniform 4.704e-5\n\nnut: uniform 4.704e-5\n\nSo the final JSON should reflect these values.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress.

Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°.

For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to set up an OpenFOAM case for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. The parameters are given, and specific files need to be generated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the case setup. The simulation is steady, incompressible, at 0° angle of attack, Mach 0.15, Re=6e6. The grid is a structured C-grid with 897x257 cells and y+ <1. The turbulence model is Spalart-Allmaras, using simpleFoam as the solver. The initial and boundary conditions are provided in JSON format.\n\nStarting with the system/controlDict. The application should be simpleFoam. The startTime is 0, endTime maybe 1000, with a writeInterval of 100. The writeFormat is ascii. The time format is steadyState since it's a steady simulation.\n\nNext, the 0/U file. The initial condition is uniform (94.08 0 0), which matches the Mach 0.15 (calculated velocity). The boundary conditions: inlet and outlet use freestreamVelocity with the same value. The airfoil has a fixedValue of (0 0 0) for no-slip. The front and back are empty because it's 2D.\n\nFor 0/p, initial is 0. The boundaries: inlet and outlet use freestreamPressure, zeroGradient on the airfoil, and empty for front/back.\n\n0/nuTilda: initial uniform 4.704e-05. Boundaries: inlet/outlet freestream, airfoil fixedValue 0, front/back empty. The nut file is similar, but the airfoil uses nutLowReWallFunction.\n\nIn constant/transportProperties, the transportModel is Newtonian, nu is 0.001568 m²/s (since Re=6e6, velocity=94.08 m/s, chord=1m, nu=U*L/Re = 94.08*1/6e6 ≈ 0.00001568, but wait, the given nuTilda initial is 4.704e-05. Wait, maybe the kinematic viscosity is different here. Wait, the user specified Re=6e6 based on chord. So nu = U*L/Re = (94.08 m/s * 1m)/6e6 = 94.08/6e6 ≈ 1.568e-5 m²/s. But in the transportProperties, the user might have set nu to this value. Let me check the given initial conditions. The initial nuTilda is 4.704e-05. Wait, Spalart-Allmaras uses nuTilda which is the modified viscosity. The actual nu (kinematic viscosity) should be calculated based on the problem's Re. Let me recalculate: Mach 0.15 at 300K, speed of sound is about 347 m/s, so velocity U = 0.15 * 347 ≈ 52.05 m/s. Wait, but the user's initial U is 94.08 m/s. Hmm, maybe the user has a different setup. But the transportProperties nu is the actual kinematic viscosity. Let me confirm. Re = U*L/nu. So nu = U*L/Re. Here, Re=6e6, L=1m, U=94.08 m/s. So nu = 94.08/(6e6) ≈ 1.568e-5 m²/s. So in transportProperties, nu should be 1.568e-5. But in the given example, the user's initial nuTilda is 4.704e-05. Since the SA model uses nuTilda as the working variable, which is different from the actual nu. But the transportProperties requires the actual kinematic viscosity. So in constant/transportProperties, nu is set to [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 1.568e-05. Let me check the user's JSON. The initial conditions for nuTilda are 4.704e-05. The user's initial nut is also 4.704e-05. But in SA model, nuTilda is the working variable, and nut is the turbulent viscosity. Wait, perhaps there's a confusion here. Wait, the Spalart-Allmaras model solves for nuTilda, which is a modified viscosity. The actual turbulent viscosity nut is computed from nuTilda. The initial value for nuTilda in the SA model is usually set to a small value, like 0.1*nu. But the user's initial nuTilda is 4.704e-05, which is higher than nu (1.568e-05). Hmm, maybe there's a scaling factor. Wait, the user's initial conditions for nuTilda and nut are both 4.704e-05. That might be correct if the initial guess for turbulent viscosity is set to some value. But the transportProperties should have the correct nu. Let me proceed with nu = 1.568e-05 in transportProperties.\n\nMoving on to system/fvSchemes. For steady-state, ddt terms are steadyState. Gradients Gauss linear. Divergence for U and nuTilda should be Gauss upwind or limited linear. Laplacian schemes Gauss linear corrected. Interpolation linear. SnGrad for wall is corrected. \n\nIn system/fvSolution, solvers for U (SIMPLE), p (GAMG), and nuTilda (smoothSolver). Relaxation factors for U and p. \n\nConstant/turbulenceProperties: RAS model is SpalartAllmaras, RASModel is on, turbulence is on, printCoeffs is on.\n\nNow, checking all the boundary conditions as per the user's JSON. Inlet and outlet have freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. Airfoil has fixedValue for U (0), zeroGradient for p, fixedValue 0 for nuTilda, and nutLowReWallFunction for nut. Front and back are empty.\n\nEach file's FoamFile header must include version, format, class, and object. For example, 0/U has class volVectorField, object U. \n\nNeed to ensure that in controlDict, the application is correctly set to simpleFoam. Also, in fvSolution, the SIMPLE algorithm is used with correct settings. The turbulenceProperties correctly specifies the RAS model.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned that the grid is already prepared, so no need for blockMeshDict. The case files should be structured correctly with all necessary directories: 0/, system/, constant/.\n\nDouble-checking all the initial and boundary conditions against the provided JSON. Especially making sure that inlet and outlet use freestream types, and the airfoil has the correct wall functions.\n\nFinally, ensuring that all files are in the correct OpenFOAM syntax, with proper FoamFile headers, and the values match the user's specifications.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14]. The specific\\nturbulence model equations are illustrated below.\\nThe fluctuation continuity equation is:\\nThe group average fluctuation velocity equation is:\\n( ) ( )\\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ 1 Turb Turb\\nj j i i j ij ij ij ij ij\\n∂ ∂ + + ∂ + − −\\n∂ ∂ ∂\\nσ σ σ σ u u u uu\\nWherein ˆ\\nu represents the group average fluctuation velocity and ˆ\\nσ the laminar stress\\ncorresponding to the fluctuation velocity after the group average, similar to the calculation\\nσ ˆ Turb\\nσ .

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident. This paper used the structured mesh of 897×257\\nfor subsequent calculation, with the airfoil wall y + <1.0.\\nFigure 1: Computational domain of NACA0012 airfoil\\nFigure 2: Computational domain grid\\nFigure 3: Computational grid near NACA0012 airfoil Figure\\nPage 6:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 4: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient\\nThe boundary conditions are inlet boundary, outlet boundary, solid wall boundary, and empty\\nboundary.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object.

Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to extract boundary conditions from a CFD paper and validate them against the OpenFOAM boundary name list, correcting any spelling mistakes but not changing the boundary types. They specified the fields U, p, nuTilda, and nut, and the boundaries inlet, outlet, and airfoil. \n\nFirst, looking at the paper excerpts, in Table 1 on Page 6, the boundary conditions are listed. For the airfoil (solid wall), the paper mentions \"no-slip adiabatic condition\", which in OpenFOAM typically translates to 'noSlip' for velocity. But checking the OpenFOAM list, 'noSlip' is indeed a valid boundary type. However, for the nut field, the paper uses 'nutLowReWallFunction', which matches the list. The p field here is 'zero gradient', so that's 'zeroGradient'. For U, 'fixedValue' is correct.\n\nFor inlet/outlet, the paper uses 'freestream velocity' for U, which corresponds to 'freestreamVelocity' in the list. The p field here is 'freestreamPressure', which is valid. The 'nuTilda' field uses 'fixed-value' with 'freestream', which should be 'fixedValue' with a freestream value. But in the OpenFOAM list, 'freestream' is a separate boundary condition. Wait, but in the paper's table, for inlet/outlet, 'U' is set to 'freestream velocity', which is 'freestreamVelocity' in OpenFOAM. Similarly, 'p' is 'freestreamPressure'. For 'nuTilda', it's 'fixed-value' with 'freestream', which might be 'fixedValue' with a freestream value. But the OpenFOAM list includes 'freestream' as a boundary type. Hmm, but looking at the fields, for 'nuTilda', the paper says 'fixed-value' and 'freestream', but the OpenFOAM list has 'freestream' as a possible boundary type. Wait, maybe the correct BC for 'nuTilda' at inlet/outlet is 'freestream' instead of 'fixedValue'. Wait, the paper's table says for inlet/outlet, 'nuTilda' is 'fixed-value' with 'freestream'. So perhaps the BC type is 'fixedValue' with a value of 'freestream'. But in OpenFOAM, 'freestream' is a BC type. Wait, I need to check. Looking at the OpenFOAM boundary list provided, there's 'freestreamVelocity' and 'freestreamPressure', but 'freestream' itself is also present. Wait, the user provided a list that includes 'freestreamVelocity' and 'freestreamPressure', but the paper's table lists 'freestream' for 'nuTilda'. Maybe in OpenFOAM, for 'nuTilda', the correct BC is 'freestream'? Or is it 'fixedValue' with a freestream value? The paper's table says 'fixed-value' under the 'nuTilda' column for inlet/outlet, and the value is 'freestream'. So perhaps the BC type is 'fixedValue' with a value of 'freestream'. However, checking the OpenFOAM list, there's a 'freestream' boundary type. But I need to validate the exact OpenFOAM BC names. The user provided a list that includes 'freestreamVelocity', 'freestreamPressure', and 'freestream' as separate entries. So for 'nuTilda', if the paper's BC is 'fixed-value' with 'freestream', perhaps in OpenFOAM, the correct BC is 'fixedValue' with a 'freestream' value. But in OpenFOAM, 'fixedValue' is a BC type where you specify a value. Alternatively, maybe the 'freestream' BC is a specific type that sets the value based on freestream conditions. But the user's instruction is to correct spelling only. The paper says 'fixed-value' which is OpenFOAM's 'fixedValue', so the BC type is 'fixedValue' with the value 'freestream'. However, the actual OpenFOAM BC for 'nuTilda' in the Spalart-Allmaras model might require a 'freestream' BC. But according to the user's provided list, 'freestream' is a valid BC name. Wait, the user's list includes 'freestream' as a boundary name. So perhaps for 'nuTilda' at inlet/outlet, the correct BC is 'freestream', not 'fixedValue'. But the paper's table says 'fixed-value' for 'nuTilda' and the value is 'freestream'. This is a bit confusing. The user's instruction is to correct spelling only. The paper's 'fixed-value' should be 'fixedValue' in OpenFOAM. So the BC type is 'fixedValue' and the value is 'freestream'. However, the OpenFOAM list has 'freestream' as a BC type. So maybe the paper's 'fixed-value' with 'freestream' is incorrect, and the correct BC type is 'freestream'. But the user says to only correct spelling, not change the boundary type. So if the paper's BC type is 'fixed-value', that's a spelling mistake. The correct BC name is 'fixedValue'. So for 'nuTilda' at inlet/outlet, BC is 'fixedValue' with value 'freestream'. But the value here is probably a specific numerical value, but the paper uses 'freestream' as the value. Alternatively, in OpenFOAM, 'freestream' might be a BC that automatically sets the value based on freestream conditions. But according to the user's instruction, we must only correct spelling. So the BC type for 'nuTilda' is 'fixedValue' as per the paper's 'fixed-value', and the value is 'freestream' (but maybe that's a typo and should be a numerical value). However, the user says not to change the boundary type except for spelling. So 'fixed-value' becomes 'fixedValue', and the value remains 'freestream'. But I need to check if 'freestream' is a valid value for 'fixedValue'. Alternatively, maybe the paper intended to use the 'freestream' BC type for 'nuTilda', but wrote 'fixed-value' by mistake. This is tricky. But the user's instruction is strict: correct only spelling, not change boundary type. So if the paper says 'fixed-value', correct to 'fixedValue'. The value part is not part of the BC type, so it's okay. Similarly, for 'nut' at inlet/outlet, the paper says 'freestream', which in OpenFOAM is 'freestream' BC. But looking at the OpenFOAM list, 'nut' might use 'nutLowReWallFunction' on the airfoil, but for inlet/outlet, the paper says 'freestream'. However, 'freestream' is a valid BC in the list. So for 'nut' at inlet/outlet, the BC is 'freestream'. But the paper's table says 'freestream' under 'nut' for inlet/outlet, which is already correct. So putting it all together:\n\nAirfoil (wall):\n- U: noSlip (since the paper says no-slip adiabatic, which is 'noSlip' in OpenFOAM)\n- p: zeroGradient (as per the paper's zero gradient)\n- nuTilda: fixedValue (the paper says fixed-value, corrected to fixedValue)\n- nut: nutLowReWallFunction (from the paper's entry)\n\nInlet/outlet:\n- U: freestreamVelocity (from the paper's freestream velocity)\n- p: freestreamPressure (from the paper's freestreamPressure)\n- nuTilda: fixedValue (paper's fixed-value corrected to fixedValue) with value freestream (but the BC type is fixedValue)\n- nut: freestream (paper's freestream, which is a valid BC)\n\nWait, but the user's OpenFOAM list includes 'freestream' as a BC type. So for 'nut' at inlet/outlet, the BC is 'freestream'. The paper's table says 'freestream' under 'nut' for inlet/outlet, which matches the OpenFOAM 'freestream' BC. So that's correct. For 'nuTilda', the paper's table says 'fixed-value' with 'freestream', so BC type is 'fixedValue', and the value is 'freestream' (which might be a field value). However, in OpenFOAM, 'fixedValue' requires a specific value, but the user's instruction is to only correct the BC type's spelling. So the BC type is 'fixedValue', and the value is as specified in the paper. Since the user only wants the BC types, not the values, perhaps the answer should just list the BC types. The user's example in the problem shows that for 'nut' on the airfoil, the BC is 'nutLowReWallFunction', which is from the paper's 'nutLowReWallFunction'. So, the final answer should have:\n\nFor each boundary (airfoil, inlet, outlet) and each field (U, p, nuTilda, nut), list the corrected BC types.\n\nSo the airfoil boundary:\n- U: noSlip (corrected from the paper's no-slip, which is 'noSlip' in OpenFOAM)\n- p: zeroGradient (paper says zero gradient)\n- nuTilda: fixedValue (paper's fixed-value)\n- nut: nutLowReWallFunction (matches the paper)\n\nInlet/outlet boundaries (inlet and outlet):\n- U: freestreamVelocity (paper's freestream velocity)\n- p: freestreamPressure (paper's freestreamPressure)\n- nuTilda: fixedValue (paper's fixed-value corrected)\n- nut: freestream (paper's freestream, which is a valid BC)\n\nThe user also mentioned that if there's a slash, like a/b, split into a and b. But in the paper's Table 1, the boundaries are Airfoil, Inlet/outlet, Front and back. However, the user wants to focus on inlet, outlet, airfoil. The 'Front and back' might be other boundaries, but the user says to ignore other boundaries. So the answer should only include inlet, outlet, airfoil.\n\nSo the final JSON would have entries for 'airfoil', 'inlet', and 'outlet' boundaries, each with their respective fields and corrected BC types.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object.

Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to simulate the NACA0012 airfoil at 0° angle of attack using OpenFOAM-v2406 with specific boundary conditions based on the paper. The provided JSON structure outlines the boundary types, and I mustn't change those. \n\nFirst, the flow conditions from the paper: Mach 0.15, Re=6e6 based on chord length, ambient temperature 300 K. The simulation is incompressible, so Mach number relates to velocity through the speed of sound. Speed of sound (a) is sqrt(γRT). For air, γ=1.4, R=287 J/kg·K. So a = sqrt(1.4*287*300) ≈ 347.2 m/s. Then velocity U = Ma * a = 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s. But wait, the paper uses incompressible flow, so maybe they use a reference velocity. Let me check the paper again.\n\nThe Reynolds number is Re=6e6, which is Re = (ρUL)/μ. Assuming standard air properties at 300 K: ρ=1.225 kg/m³, μ=1.7894e-5 kg/(m·s). Solving for U: U = (Re * μ)/(ρ * L). Chord length L=1m (dimensionless in the paper, but actual units matter for calculation). So U = (6e6 * 1.7894e-5)/(1.225 * 1) ≈ (107.364)/1.225 ≈ 87.63 m/s. Wait, this conflicts with the Mach number calculation. Hmm, the paper says Mach 0.15, but if U is 87.63 m/s, then Mach would be 87.63/347.2 ≈ 0.252. That's a discrepancy. Maybe the paper uses a different reference temperature or the Mach number is low enough that incompressible assumption holds despite the actual Mach. The user mentioned non-dimensional parameters, so perhaps they expect using Re and Ma to derive the necessary fields.\n\nBut since it's incompressible, maybe the pressure is calculated differently. The freestreamPressure in OpenFOAM for incompressible solvers is often set to zero gradient or a fixed value, but the paper's boundary conditions table (Table 1) shows inlet/outlet for p as freestreamPressure. The initial pressure field might be set to a reference value, maybe zero.\n\nFor nuTilda (Spalart-Allmaras variable), the inlet and outlet use fixedValue. The paper's boundary conditions table lists nuTilda as fixedValue for airfoil, inlet, and outlet. The value for nuTilda in S-A model is typically around 3 to 5 times the kinematic viscosity ν. ν = μ/ρ = 1.7894e-5 / 1.225 ≈ 1.46e-5 m²/s. So nuTilda could be set to 3*ν ≈ 4.38e-5, but the exact value might depend on the freestream turbulence. However, in many cases, a small value like 0.1*ν is used for smooth flows. Wait, the paper's Table 1 says nuTilda is fixedValue for airfoil, inlet, and outlet. The S-A model's nuTilda at the inlet is usually set to a fraction of the kinematic viscosity. According to the Spalart-Allmaras model, the freestream value for nuTilda is typically set between 0.1ν to 10ν. Let me check the OpenFOAM documentation. For the S-A model, the freestream nuTilda is often set to 3ν or similar. Let's compute ν = 1.7894e-5 / 1.225 ≈ 1.46e-5 m²/s. So 3ν ≈ 4.38e-5. But the exact value might be specified in the paper. Looking back, the paper mentions the S-A model but doesn't specify the nuTilda values. So perhaps the user expects using a standard value. Alternatively, since the paper uses Re=6e6, and the chord is 1m, the nuTilda could be calculated based on that. Alternatively, in OpenFOAM's SA model, the initial and boundary conditions for nuTilda are often set to 0.1 or similar, but I need to convert properly.\n\nWait, the user wants to convert non-dimensional parameters to field values. The key parameters are Re=6e6, Ma=0.15, T=300K. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the kinematic viscosity ν = μ/ρ. But given Re=ρUL/μ, rearranged as ν = UL/Re. Given U is to be determined from Ma and speed of sound. But for incompressible, maybe Ma isn't directly used, but the velocity is derived from Re. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the paper states Mach=0.15 and Re=6e6. Since it's incompressible, the Mach number is low, so the actual velocity is U=Ma*a. But Re is also given. Let's check if these are consistent. Using U=Ma*a=0.15*347.2≈52.08 m/s. Then Re= (U*L)/ν → ν= (U*L)/Re = (52.08 * 1)/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s. Then μ=ν*ρ=8.68e-6 *1.225≈1.063e-5 kg/(m·s). But standard air at 300K has μ≈1.846e-5 kg/(m·s). This inconsistency suggests that the paper might have defined Re based on a different velocity or length. Alternatively, perhaps the chord length isn't 1m in actual units. Wait, in the paper, the chord length is dimensionless c=1.0, but in reality, it's scaled. Wait, the user is setting up the case, so perhaps the actual chord length is 1m, and the Re is based on that. So to reconcile Ma=0.15 and Re=6e6, we need to find U and ν such that both are satisfied. But that's impossible unless the temperature is adjusted. Alternatively, the paper might have a typo, but the user wants to proceed with the given parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the simulation uses the incompressible solver, so Mach number isn't directly used in the setup, but the velocity is derived from Re. Let's proceed with Re=6e6, chord length L=1m, and standard air properties at 300K. Then U = Re * ν / L. ν for air at 300K is 1.568e-5 m²/s (calculating using μ=1.846e-5 kg/(m·s) and ρ=1.225 kg/m³ gives ν=1.846e-5 /1.225≈1.507e-5 m²/s). Then U=6e6 *1.507e-5 /1≈ 90.42 m/s. But this gives a Mach number of 90.42/347.2≈0.26, which is higher than the paper's 0.15. This inconsistency needs to be resolved. \n\nWait, the paper says \"low-speed flow around NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\". So the Mach number is 0.15, which would correspond to U=0.15*347.2≈52.08 m/s. Then Re= (U*L)/ν → ν= (52.08 *1)/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s. But this ν is lower than standard air's ν at 300K. To achieve this ν, the temperature would have to be higher, or the pressure different. Alternatively, the problem might be using a different reference length or velocity. \n\nThis is getting complicated. The user wants to set up the case with the given parameters. Let's proceed by calculating the necessary fields based on the provided Re and Ma. Assuming ideal gas, but since it's incompressible, perhaps the density is constant. Let's assume standard sea-level conditions: T=300K, p=101325 Pa, ρ=1.225 kg/m³, μ=1.7894e-5 kg/(m·s), ν=1.46e-5 m²/s. Then Re=6e6 = (U * L)/ν → U= (Re * ν)/L = (6e6 *1.46e-5)/1 ≈ 87.6 m/s. Mach number would be U/a =87.6/347.2≈0.252, which conflicts with the paper's Mach 0.15. So there's a discrepancy here. \n\nBut the user says the flow condition might be given as non-dimensional parameters, and we need to convert these to field values. The key is to define U, p, nuTilda, nut (turbulent viscosity) based on Re=6e6, Ma=0.15, and T=300K. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate speed of sound a= sqrt(γRT) = sqrt(1.4*287*300)≈347.2 m/s. Then U=Ma*a=0.15*347.2≈52.08 m/s. Re=6e6 = (ρ U L)/μ → solve for μ= (ρ U L)/Re. Assuming L=1m (chord length), ρ=1.225 kg/m³, then μ= (1.225 *52.08 *1)/6e6 ≈ (63.83)/6e6≈1.064e-5 kg/(m·s). Then ν=μ/ρ≈1.064e-5/1.225≈8.68e-6 m²/s. This ν is lower than standard air, but perhaps the simulation uses these values. \n\nNow, for the Spalart-Allmaras model, the turbulent viscosity ν_t is computed from nuTilda. The freestream value for nuTilda is typically set between 3ν to 5ν. So nuTilda_inlet = 3ν ≈3*8.68e-6≈2.6e-5. The nut (turbulent viscosity) in OpenFOAM for SA model is computed as nut = nuTilda * fv1, where fv1 is a function of nuTilda/ν. In the freestream, fv1 approaches 1 when nuTilda/ν is small, so nut ≈ nuTilda. Therefore, nut_inlet would be approximately 2.6e-5. But according to the boundary conditions provided, nut at inlet/outlet is set to 'freestream', which in OpenFOAM usually takes the value specified in the turbulenceProperties dictionary. Alternatively, in the boundary conditions, 'freestream' might require a value. Wait, the user's JSON specifies \"nut\": \"freestream\" for inlet and outlet. In OpenFOAM, 'freestream' is a mixed BC that uses a freestream value and a valueFraction. But perhaps in this context, the user expects 'freestream' to be a fixedValue with the freestream nut value. However, the exact setup might require specifying the freestreamValue for nut. But the user's instruction says to convert the flow parameters to field values. The nut freestream value can be calculated based on the turbulence model. For the S-A model, in the freestream, the turbulent viscosity is typically a small fraction of the molecular viscosity. But in this case, since the flow is low-speed and the paper doesn't specify turbulence intensity, perhaps nut is set to a small value. Alternatively, using the S-A model's recommendation, nuTilda is set to 3ν, and nut is approximately equal to nuTilda in the freestream. So nut_freestream = nuTilda_freestream ≈3ν ≈2.6e-5. \n\nFor initial conditions, the fields U, p, nuTilda, nut need to be initialized. The initial U would be the freestream velocity (52.08 m/s) in the inlet direction. The pressure is typically initialized to zero in incompressible solvers, but might be set to a reference value. The paper's boundary conditions for p are 'freestreamPressure' at inlet/outlet, which in OpenFOAM is usually a fixedValue with a value of 0 (relative pressure). So initial p could be 0. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Airfoil (wall) boundaries: U is noSlip (0 velocity), p zeroGradient, nuTilda fixedValue (0? Wait, no. For walls in SA model, nuTilda is typically set to 0. But according to the paper's Table 1, nuTilda is fixedValue for airfoil. So what value? The SA model requires nuTilda=0 at walls. So airfoil's nuTilda should be fixedValue 0. \n\nWait, checking the paper's Table 1: Airfoil's nuTilda is fixedValue. The S-A model's wall boundary condition for nuTilda is typically zero, so fixedValue 0. Similarly, nut at the airfoil uses nutLowReWallFunction, which enforces nut=0 at the wall. \n\nInlet and Outlet: U is freestreamVelocity (52.08 m/s). For incompressible, direction matters. Assuming the inlet is a velocity inlet with U (52.08, 0, 0) m/s. Pressure is freestreamPressure, which is 0 (relative). nuTilda is fixedValue with 3ν ≈2.6e-5. nut is freestream, which would be the same as nuTilda (since in freestream, nut ≈ nuTilda). \n\nInitial conditions:\n- U: uniform (52.08 0 0)\n- p: uniform 0\n- nuTilda: uniform 2.6e-5\n- nut: uniform 2.6e-5\n\nBut wait, according to the SA model, the initial and boundary conditions for nuTilda should be set properly. If the freestream nuTilda is 3ν, then that's the value. \n\nSo compiling all this into the JSON structure provided by the user, the final answer should have:\n\n- Airfoil BCs: U=noSlip (0), p=zeroGradient, nuTilda=fixedValue 0, nut=nutLowReWallFunction (which in OpenFOAM doesn't require a value, just the type).\n\n- Inlet and Outlet: U=freestreamVelocity (52.08 m/s), p=freestreamPressure (0), nuTilda=fixedValue 2.6e-5, nut=freestream (which in OpenFOAM may need a value, but the user's JSON specifies the type as 'freestream', so perhaps the value is set in the turbulenceProperties. However, the user wants field values converted from parameters, so the 'freestream' for nut would have a value of 2.6e-5).\n\nBut the user's JSON specifies the types, not the values. Wait, the user says: \"Convert these flow parameters to the field values.\" So the actual numerical values need to be filled in for each boundary's fields. For example, 'freestreamVelocity' would have a value of (52.08 0 0), 'fixedValue' for nuTilda would have 2.6e-5 at inlet and outlet, and 0 at the airfoil. The 'freestreamPressure' is 0. \n\nSo the final JSON would look like this, with numerical values based on the calculations.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2.

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident. This paper used the structured mesh of 897×257\\nfor subsequent calculation, with the airfoil wall y + <1.0.\\nFigure 1: Computational domain of NACA0012 airfoil\\nFigure 2: Computational domain grid\\nFigure 3: Computational grid near NACA0012 airfoil Figure\\nPage 6:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 4: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient\\nThe boundary conditions are inlet boundary, outlet boundary, solid wall boundary, and empty\\nboundary.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results.

Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to set up an OpenFOAM case for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil at 0° angle of attack using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. They provided specific boundary conditions and initial settings in JSON format. The goal is to generate all necessary case files without the blockMeshDict since the mesh is already prepared.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure of an OpenFOAM case. The main directories are 0/, system/, and constant/. The 0/ directory contains initial and boundary condition files for each field (U, p, nuTilda, nut). The system/ directory includes controlDict, fvSchemes, and fvSolution. The constant/ directory has transportProperties and turbulenceProperties.\n\nStarting with system/controlDict: The application should be simpleFoam for steady incompressible flow. The user specified OpenFOAM-v2406, so I'll set the version accordingly. The startTime is 0, endTime 1000, writeInterval 100, and deltaT 1. The writeFormat is ascii. I'll make sure the application entry is correct.\n\nNext, 0/U: The initial velocity is uniform (52.08, 0, 0). The boundary conditions for the airfoil (wall) are noSlip for U, zeroGradient for p, fixedValue 0 for nuTilda, and nutLowReWallFunction for nut. Inlet and outlet use freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. The front and back (empty) boundaries are set to empty. I'll apply these settings to each field file.\n\nFor 0/p, the initial value is 0, with similar boundary conditions. The nuTilda file initializes to 2.6e-5, with fixedValue at inlet/outlet and 0 on the airfoil. The nut file uses uniform 2.6e-5 initially, with freestream at inlet/outlet and nutLowReWallFunction on the airfoil.\n\nIn constant/transportProperties, since it's incompressible, the kinematic viscosity (nu) is calculated using nu = mu/rho. Given Re=6e6, chord length c=1m, and velocity U=52.08 m/s, nu = (U*c)/Re = 52.08/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s. But wait, the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-5. Maybe they set nu differently. Let me check the JSON: the initial nuTilda and nut are 2.6e-5. The transportProperties should have nu [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 2.6e-05. Wait, no—nu is the kinematic viscosity. The SA model uses nuTilda, which is similar to the modified viscosity. But in the transportProperties, nu is the laminar kinematic viscosity. From the paper, the Reynolds number is based on chord length (c=1m), Mach 0.15, so U=0.15*340≈51 m/s. But the user's JSON specifies U=52.08, which gives Re= (52.08 *1)/ (nu) =6e6 → nu=52.08/6e6≈8.68e-6. But in their initial conditions, nuTilda is 2.6e-5. That might be an error. However, the user's JSON says initial nuTilda is 2.6e-5. Maybe they intended that. So in transportProperties, set nu to the laminar viscosity, which would be 8.68e-6. But the user's JSON initial has nuTilda as 2.6e-5. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the user provided the correct nu value. Alternatively, perhaps the nu in transportProperties should match the initial nuTilda. But according to the SA model, nuTilda is a modified viscosity. The initial value for nuTilda is typically set to a fraction of the laminar viscosity. Hmm, but the user's initial conditions specify nuTilda as 2.6e-5. Maybe I should follow the user's JSON exactly, even if there's a discrepancy. Since the user provided specific initial values, I'll set transportProperties' nu to match the initial conditions. Wait no—nu in transportProperties is the laminar viscosity, which is separate from nuTilda. The SA model uses nuTilda as the working variable. So nu in transportProperties should be the actual kinematic viscosity (8.68e-6), while nuTilda's initial value is 2.6e-5. But the user's JSON specifies initial nuTilda as 2.6e-5. Maybe they intended to set nuTilda to 3*nu (common practice) which would be 2.6e-5 if nu is 8.68e-6. 8.68e-6 *3 ≈ 2.6e-5. That makes sense. So in transportProperties, nu is 8.68e-6. But the user's JSON has nuTilda initial as 2.6e-5, which aligns with 3*nu. Therefore, in constant/transportProperties, set nu to 8.68e-6. However, the user's JSON doesn't specify this. Wait, the user's JSON has initial nuTilda as 2.6e-5 and nut as 2.6e-5. But in OpenFOAM, nut is the turbulent viscosity, which for SA model is calculated from nuTilda. The initial nut might be set to zero, but the user has it as 2.6e-5. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I need to follow their JSON. Let me proceed with the files as per the user's specifications.\n\nIn constant/turbulenceProperties, the simulationType is RAS, RASModel is SpalartAllmaras, and turbulence is on, printCoeffs is on.\n\nFor system/fvSchemes, use Gauss linear for grad, div, laplacian. Interpolation schemes as linear. snGrad corrected for the wall.\n\nIn system/fvSolution, the solvers for U, p, nuTilda. SIMPLE algorithm with relaxation factors. Residual controls.\n\nNow, cross-checking all boundary conditions. The airfoil (wall) has U as noSlip, p zeroGradient, nuTilda fixedValue 0, nut nutLowReWallFunction. Inlet and outlet for U and p are freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. For nuTilda and nut, inlet/outlet have fixedValue 2.6e-5 (nuTilda) and freestream 2.6e-5 (nut). Front and back are empty.\n\nEach file's FoamFile header must be correct. For example, 0/U has class volVectorField, object U. Similarly for other fields.\n\nMake sure all files are structured correctly, no typos in boundary names (airfoil, inlet, outlet, front, back). The user's JSON mentions front and back as empty, so those boundaries should have type empty.\n\nAlso, check that in system/controlDict, the application is simpleFoam. The user emphasized this.\n\nFinally, ensure that all entries in the JSON are accurately translated into the respective files. For example, the initial conditions for U, p, nuTilda, nut are uniform values as specified. Boundary types match the JSON (noSlip, freestreamVelocity, etc.).\n\nPotential issues: The user's initial nut is set to 2.6e-5, but for the SA model, the nut is calculated from nuTilda. However, in OpenFOAM, the initial value for nut might be computed automatically. But since the user specified it, I'll set it as per their instruction.\n\nI think that covers all necessary files and settings. Now, structure each file's content according to OpenFOAM syntax and the user's requirements.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress.

The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract boundary conditions from the provided research paper excerpts, validate them against OpenFOAM's boundary name list, correct any spelling mistakes without changing the boundary types, and present the results in a JSON format. \n\nFirst, I need to find where the boundary conditions are mentioned in the paper. Looking at the excerpts, on Page 4, Table 1 lists the boundary conditions used in OpenFOAM for the computational domain. The boundaries mentioned are Airfoil, Inlet/outlet, and Front and back. But the user is interested in the boundaries for 'outlet', 'inlet', and 'airfoil'. \n\nIn Table 1, the Airfoil boundary uses 'fixedValue' for U, 'zeroGradient' for p, 'fixedValue' for nuTilda, and 'nutLowReWallFunction' for nut. The Inlet/outlet boundary uses 'freestreamVelocity' for U, 'freestreamPressure' for p, 'freestream' for nuTilda and nut. The Front and back boundaries are set to 'empty'.\n\nBut the user specified to focus on outlet, inlet, and airfoil. The paper mentions Inlet/outlet as a combined boundary. However, in OpenFOAM, inlet and outlet are typically separate. The paper might have a typo here, combining them. The correct approach is to split Inlet/outlet into 'inlet' and 'outlet' if they are separate, but according to the table, they are treated as the same boundary. However, the user wants them as distinct boundaries. Maybe the paper intended to use the same conditions for both inlet and outlet, but that's not standard. Alternatively, the 'Inlet/outlet' might be a single boundary type in the paper, but in OpenFOAM, they should be separate. However, the user instructs to correct only spelling, not the boundary type.\n\nWait, the user says: \"When boundary names include a slash (e.g., a/b), they must be divided into distinct boundaries ('a' and 'b') and listed separately.\" So 'Inlet/outlet' should be split into 'inlet' and 'outlet'. But in the paper's Table 1, the Inlet/outlet is a single boundary. However, looking at the OpenFOAM boundary list, there's 'inletOutlet' which is a valid type, but the user says to split them. The user's instruction is to split any boundaries with a slash into separate ones. So in the paper's Table 1, 'Inlet/outlet' is a single boundary, but according to the user's rule, it should be split into 'inlet' and 'outlet'. However, the paper's actual setup might have a single boundary for both, but the user wants them separated. This is a bit conflicting. Let me check the OpenFOAM boundary list provided. The list includes 'inletOutlet' as a valid type. But the user says to split if there's a slash. So 'Inlet/outlet' in the paper should be split into 'inlet' and 'outlet' as separate boundaries. But how to determine their conditions? The table shows 'Inlet/outlet' uses 'freestreamVelocity' for U, 'freestreamPressure' for p, and 'freestream' for nuTilda and nut. If we split into 'inlet' and 'outlet', do they both use the same conditions? That might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the paper's 'Inlet/outlet' is a typo for 'inletOutlet', which is a valid OpenFOAM boundary. But the user says to correct spelling only. Let me check the OpenFOAM list. The list includes 'inletOutlet' as a boundary type. So if the paper wrote 'Inlet/outlet', that's a spelling mistake. The correct OpenFOAM name is 'inletOutlet'. So I need to correct 'Inlet/outlet' to 'inletOutlet'. But the user says to split into separate boundaries if there's a slash. Hmm, this is confusing. The user's instruction is strict: split slashes into separate boundaries. So even if the intended boundary is 'inletOutlet', the presence of a slash in the name requires splitting. But in the paper's Table 1, the boundary is labeled 'Inlet/outlet', which has a slash. So according to the user's rule, split into 'inlet' and 'outlet' as separate boundaries. But then, what are their conditions? The table lists the same conditions for both. However, in reality, inlet and outlet would have different conditions. For example, inlet might have fixedValue for velocity, and outlet might have inletOutlet or zeroGradient. But according to the paper, they applied 'freestreamVelocity' and 'freestreamPressure' to the Inlet/outlet. Since the user wants to split them, perhaps both 'inlet' and 'outlet' have the same conditions as per the table. But this might not be correct. However, the user's instruction is to split the names but not change the boundary types. Wait, the user says: \"YOU MUST NOT CHANGE THE BOUNDARY TYPE EXCEPT FOR SPELLING CORRECTION.\" So if the original boundary in the paper is 'Inlet/outlet', which is a typo for 'inletOutlet', then correct the spelling to 'inletOutlet'. But the user says to split into separate boundaries if there's a slash. So this is conflicting. Let me re-examine the exact wording: \"When boundary names include a slash (e.g., a/b), they must be divided into distinct boundaries ('a' and 'b') and listed separately.\" So if the paper's boundary is named 'Inlet/outlet', split into 'inlet' and 'outlet'. But in the OpenFOAM list, 'inletOutlet' is a valid type, which is a single boundary. So the paper's 'Inlet/outlet' is likely a typo for 'inletOutlet'. Therefore, correcting the spelling to 'inletOutlet' and keeping it as a single boundary. But the user's instruction is to split slashes. This is a bit of a dilemma. However, the user says to correct spelling only. So 'Inlet/outlet' is misspelled; the correct OpenFOAM name is 'inletOutlet'. Therefore, correct the spelling and keep it as a single boundary. But the user's example shows that a/b should be split into a and b. So perhaps the paper's 'Inlet/outlet' is a typo, and the intended boundaries are 'inlet' and 'outlet' as separate. But in the table, they are treated as a single boundary. Alternatively, maybe the paper intended to use 'inlet' and 'outlet' as separate boundaries but incorrectly combined them. Given the user's instruction to split slashes, I'll proceed to split 'Inlet/outlet' into 'inlet' and 'outlet' and assign the same conditions to both. But in reality, inlet and outlet would have different conditions. However, according to the table, both use 'freestreamVelocity' for U, which might not be correct for an outlet. Alternatively, perhaps the 'Inlet/outlet' is a single boundary of type 'inletOutlet', which in OpenFOAM is a boundary that acts as inlet or outlet depending on the flow direction. So correcting the spelling to 'inletOutlet' would be appropriate. Let me check the OpenFOAM boundary list provided. Yes, 'inletOutlet' is present. Therefore, the correct spelling is 'inletOutlet', and the boundary type is a single one. So the original paper's 'Inlet/outlet' is a typo and should be corrected to 'inletOutlet'. Thus, no splitting is needed; it's a single boundary. Then, the 'Front and back' boundaries are set to 'empty', which is correct as per OpenFOAM's 'empty' boundary. \n\nNow, focusing on the specific boundaries the user asked for: outlet, inlet, and airfoil. The paper's 'Inlet/outlet' boundary, after correction to 'inletOutlet', covers both inlet and outlet as a single boundary. But the user wants them as separate. This is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the paper uses 'freestream' boundary conditions for both inlet and outlet. Looking at the OpenFOAM list, 'freestream' is a valid boundary type. The table shows that for Inlet/outlet, U is 'freestreamVelocity', p is 'freestreamPressure', and nuTilda and nut are 'freestream'. So perhaps the correct boundary types for inlet and outlet are 'freestream' with specific patches. But I need to map each field correctly. \n\nFor the airfoil (solid wall), the boundary conditions are: U is 'fixedValue' (no-slip), p is 'zeroGradient', nuTilda is 'fixedValue', and nut is 'nutLowReWallFunction'. These are valid OpenFOAM types. \n\nFor the inlet and outlet: The paper uses 'freestreamVelocity' for U, which is a valid OpenFOAM boundary (found in the list as 'freestreamVelocity'). Similarly, 'freestreamPressure' for p, and 'freestream' for nuTilda and nut. So the inlet and outlet boundaries (after splitting) would each have these conditions. But in the paper, they are combined as 'Inlet/outlet', which after correction to 'inletOutlet' or split into 'inlet' and 'outlet' with the same conditions. \n\nHowever, according to the user's instruction, since the original name has a slash, we must split into 'inlet' and 'outlet' as separate boundaries. Therefore, both 'inlet' and 'outlet' would have the same conditions as per the table: U=freestreamVelocity, p=freestreamPressure, nuTilda=freestream, nut=freestream. But in reality, outlet might have different conditions like 'zeroGradient' for p. However, the user's instruction is to not change the boundary types, only correct spelling. So even if the setup is incorrect, we must retain the types as per the paper, only correcting spelling. \n\nWait, the user says: \"You must validate the boundary type against the OpenFOAM boundary name list and correct them. You must only correct the spelling and mustn't change boundary type.\" So for each field (U, p, etc.), check if the boundary condition name is correctly spelled according to the OpenFOAM list. For example, in the table, for the airfoil's nut, it's 'nutLowReWallFunction', which is present in the OpenFOAM list as 'nutLowReWallFunction'. That's correct. For the inlet/outlet's U: 'freestreamVelocity' is in the list. p: 'freestreamPressure' is in the list. nuTilda: 'freestream' is in the list. nut: 'freestream' is in the list. So all these are correctly spelled. Therefore, the only correction needed is splitting 'Inlet/outlet' into 'inlet' and 'outlet' as separate boundaries, each with the same conditions. \n\nThus, the final JSON should have:\n\n- airfoil boundary with the specified conditions.\n- inlet boundary with freestreamVelocity, freestreamPressure, freestream, freestream.\n- outlet boundary with the same conditions as inlet.\n\nBut wait, in OpenFOAM, typically, inlet and outlet have different conditions. For example, inlet may have fixedValue for velocity and outlet may have zeroGradient. However, the paper's setup uses 'freestream' conditions for both, which might be a specific case. The user's instruction is to extract as per the paper, only correcting spelling and splitting slashes. \n\nTherefore, the corrected boundaries are:\n\nairfoil: U=fixedValue, p=zeroGradient, nuTilda=fixedValue, nut=nutLowReWallFunction.\n\ninlet: U=freestreamVelocity, p=freestreamPressure, nuTilda=freestream, nut=freestream.\n\noutlet: U=freestreamVelocity, p=freestreamPressure, nuTilda=freestream, nut=freestream.\n\nBut wait, in the paper's Table 1, 'Inlet/outlet' is a single boundary. But according to the user's instruction, we must split into 'inlet' and 'outlet'. However, the paper might have intended that both inlet and outlet use the same boundary conditions. So the JSON should reflect that both inlet and outlet have the same conditions as per the table. \n\nThus, the final JSON structure would list each boundary (airfoil, inlet, outlet) with their respective fields and corrected boundary types.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2.

Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the initial and boundary conditions for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil case described in the paper using OpenFOAM-v2406. The user provided a JSON structure that must be strictly followed, so I can't change any boundary types. Let me go through the paper excerpts to extract the necessary parameters.\n\nFirst, the paper mentions the flow conditions: Mach number 0.15, Reynolds number 6e6 based on chord length, and ambient temperature 300 K. The airfoil is at 0° angle of attack, and the simulation is steady and incompressible. The turbulence model is Spalart-Allmaras (S-A), and they used a structured C-grid with 897×257 cells, y+ <1.\n\nThe boundary conditions in the JSON are divided into airfoil, inlet, outlet. The types are fixedValue, zeroGradient, etc., as specified. The task is to convert the non-dimensional parameters (Re, Ma) into field values for velocity (U), pressure (p), nuTilda, and nut.\n\nStarting with Mach number 0.15. Since it's incompressible, Mach number might be used to calculate velocity, but incompressible solvers often use kinematic viscosity instead. The Reynolds number Re = ρUL/μ = 6e6. Assuming the chord length L is 1m (common in simulations), and for air at 300 K, the properties are: ρ = 1.225 kg/m³, μ = 1.7894e-05 Pa·s. But wait, the paper says Re is based on chord length and inflow conditions. Let me check: Re = (ρ * U * L)/μ. Solving for U: U = (Re * μ)/(ρ * L). Plugging in Re=6e6, μ=1.7894e-05, ρ=1.225, L=1 (if chord is 1m), then U ≈ (6e6 * 1.7894e-05)/(1.225 * 1) ≈ (107.364)/1.225 ≈ 87.67 m/s. But Mach 0.15 at 300 K would give a different velocity. Speed of sound a = sqrt(γRT), where γ=1.4, R=287 J/kg·K, T=300 K. So a ≈ sqrt(1.4*287*300) ≈ sqrt(120,540) ≈ 347.2 m/s. Mach 0.15 gives U = 0.15*347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. The paper states Mach=0.15 and Re=6e6. How to reconcile? Since it's incompressible, maybe the Mach number is just for reference, and the actual velocity is derived from Re. Let me double-check the paper. The paper says \"inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds number of 6×10^6 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature of 300 K.\" So both Mach and Re are given. That's conflicting unless they're using a specific gas or conditions. Let's calculate U from both. If Mach=0.15, then U=0.15*a=0.15*347.2≈52.08 m/s. Then Re= (ρ*U*L)/μ. Solving for Re with U=52.08, L=1m, ρ=1.225, μ=1.7894e-05: Re=(1.225*52.08*1)/(1.7894e-05) ≈ (63.798)/1.7894e-05 ≈ 3.564e6. But the paper says Re=6e6. So there's a mismatch. This suggests that either the density or viscosity is different, or the chord length isn't 1m. Alternatively, maybe the chord length is different. Let's solve for L. If Re=6e6, U=52.08 m/s, then L=(Re*μ)/(ρ*U) = (6e6 * 1.7894e-05)/(1.225 *52.08) ≈ (107.364)/(63.798) ≈ 1.683 meters. But the paper says chord length is characteristic length c=1.0. Hmm, perhaps the paper uses a different reference velocity or the fluid properties aren't standard air. Alternatively, maybe they adjusted the kinematic viscosity to match both Re and Ma. Let's think in terms of kinematic viscosity ν=μ/ρ. Re=UL/ν. So ν=UL/Re. If U=Ma*a, then ν=(0.15*a)*L / Re. For Re=6e6, L=1m, a=347.2 m/s, ν=(0.15*347.2*1)/6e6 ≈ 52.08/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-06 m²/s. But kinematic viscosity of air at 300K is ν=μ/ρ=1.7894e-05/1.225≈1.46e-05 m²/s. So they must be using a different fluid or adjusted parameters. This is confusing. The paper might have defined the problem with specific values, so perhaps we need to take the given Re and Ma and compute the necessary fields.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simulation uses dimensional values where U is set to match both Ma and Re by adjusting the fluid properties. But in incompressible flow, Mach number isn't directly a parameter, so maybe the Ma is just for reference, and the actual velocity is computed from Re. Let's proceed with Re=6e6, chord L=1m, and compute U. Using standard air properties: ν=1.46e-05 m²/s. Then U=Re*ν/L = 6e6 * 1.46e-05 /1 = 87.6 m/s. But this contradicts the Mach 0.15. The paper might have a typo or uses a different approach. However, the user wants to convert the given Re and Ma into field values. Let's proceed with the given data.\n\nAssuming the problem is incompressible, the Mach number might be a red herring, and the actual velocity is determined by Re. So using Re=6e6, chord L=1m, and standard air at 300K, U= (Re * ν)/L = 6e6 * 1.46e-05 ≈ 87.6 m/s. But the paper says Mach 0.15, which would be 52 m/s. This inconsistency needs resolution. The paper might have used a different reference velocity or non-dimensionalized parameters. Alternatively, maybe the simulation uses a specific gas with different properties. Since the user wants to set up the case, perhaps they expect us to use the given Re and Ma to compute the correct velocity. Let's try to reconcile both.\n\nGiven Ma=0.15 and Re=6e6, and T=300K. For air, a=sqrt(γRT)=sqrt(1.4*287*300)≈347.2 m/s. So U=0.15*347.2≈52.08 m/s. Then Re= (U*L)/ν → ν= (U*L)/Re = (52.08*1)/6e6 ≈8.68e-06 m²/s. Kinematic viscosity ν=μ/ρ, so if ν=8.68e-06, then μ=ν*ρ. Assuming standard ρ=1.225 kg/m³, μ=8.68e-06*1.225≈1.063e-05 Pa·s. But this is different from standard air's μ=1.7894e-05. So to satisfy both Re and Ma, the fluid properties must be adjusted. However, in OpenFOAM for incompressible flow, the transport properties are typically set via kinematic viscosity (nu). So in this case, nu would be set to 8.68e-06 m²/s. But the user might not have mentioned this, so perhaps the initial conditions are for velocity, pressure, nuTilda, and nut.\n\nThe boundary conditions for U in inlet and outlet are freestreamVelocity, which would be the computed U=52.08 m/s. The pressure is freestreamPressure, which for incompressible is often set to zero gradient or a reference value, but the paper uses incompressible N-S equations, so pressure is relative. The initial conditions for p could be 0, but in OpenFOAM, freestreamPressure might be set to a value, perhaps 0.\n\nFor the S-A model, nuTilda (ν~) is the modified viscosity. The freestream value for nuTilda is typically set to a fraction of the kinematic viscosity, often between 3 to 5 times ν. But according to the S-A model, in the freestream, ν~ is usually set to 3ν or similar. However, the exact value might depend on the implementation. Alternatively, the user might set nuTilda to a small value, but the paper doesn't specify. The nut (ν_t) is the turbulent viscosity, which in the freestream is typically low. The nutLowReWallFunction on the airfoil enforces the wall treatment for turbulent viscosity.\n\nPutting this all together, the initial and boundary conditions would be:\n\nFor U: initial value 52.08 m/s (inlet and outlet freestreamVelocity same value). But the paper's Re is based on chord and inflow conditions, so U is calculated as above.\n\nFor pressure, initial p=0, with freestreamPressure (probably zero gradient or fixed value, but in OpenFOAM, for incompressible, often set to zero gradient at inlet/outlet, but the JSON specifies freestreamPressure for inlet and outlet. So perhaps p is set to 0 with zero gradient, but the JSON says inlet and outlet have freestreamPressure. Need to check how OpenFOAM's freestreamPressure works. It might be a fixedValue with a reference pressure, possibly 0.\n\nFor nuTilda, the freestream value is typically set to 3*ν or similar. Given ν=8.68e-06, nuTilda_freestream = 3*8.68e-06 ≈2.6e-05. But the exact value might be case-dependent. However, the paper doesn't specify, so this is an assumption.\n\nnut in the freestream is often set to zero or a small value. But in the S-A model, nut is calculated from nuTilda. The freestream nut might be set to zero or calculated based on the model.\n\nBut the user wants the JSON with the specified boundary types and the converted field values. Let me structure this.\n\nThe initial conditions would be uniform values for U, p, nuTilda, and nut. For U: 52.08 m/s in x-direction (assuming angle of attack 0°, so flow is along x). Pressure initial is 0 (or reference). nuTilda initial is 3*ν. nut initial is calculated from nuTilda via the S-A model.\n\nBut in the JSON, the user wants the initial and boundary conditions. The JSON structure provided has:\n\nairfoil: U=fixedValue, p=zeroGradient, nuTilda=fixedValue, nut=nutLowReWallFunction\n\ninlet: U=freestreamVelocity, p=freestreamPressure, nuTilda=freestream, nut=freestream\n\noutlet: same as inlet.\n\nThe \"freestream\" values are probably the freestream conditions. So for U, inlet and outlet have a fixedValue with value U=52.08 m/s (direction along x). For pressure, freestreamPressure might be a fixedValue of 0. nuTilda's freestream value is 3*ν. nut's freestream is likely 0, but in the S-A model, nut=nuTilda * f_v1, where f_v1 is a function. However, in the freestream, nuTilda is typically 3ν to 5ν, and nut would be computed accordingly.\n\nBut the user wants the exact values. Let me try to compute them.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Ma = 0.15\n\n- T = 300 K\n\n- Re = 6e6 (based on chord c=1m)\n\nCompute U using Ma: a = sqrt(γRT) = sqrt(1.4*287*300) ≈ 347.2 m/s\n\nU = Ma * a = 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s\n\nCompute kinematic viscosity ν = U * c / Re = (52.08 * 1)/6e6 ≈8.68e-06 m²/s\n\nFor the S-A model, the freestream nuTilda is typically set to between 3ν and 5ν. Let's choose 3ν = 3 * 8.68e-06 ≈ 2.604e-05.\n\nThe nut (turbulent viscosity) in the freestream for S-A model is computed as:\n\nnut = nuTilda * f_v1\n\nWhere f_v1 is a function of chi = nuTilda / nu (ν is the kinematic viscosity)\n\nchi = 2.604e-05 / 8.68e-06 ≈ 3.0\n\nf_v1 = chi^3 / (chi^3 + cv1^3), where cv1=7.1\n\ncv1^3 = 357.911\n\nchi^3 = 27\n\nf_v1 = 27 / (27 + 357.911) ≈27/384.911≈0.0701\n\nnut = 2.604e-05 * 0.0701 ≈1.827e-06 m²/s\n\nBut in the freestream, turbulence is usually low, so nut is small. However, in the JSON, the inlet/outlet nut is set to \"freestream\", which in OpenFOAM's SA model would typically be the same as nuTilda's freestream value multiplied by f_v1. But this might be more complex. Alternatively, in some implementations, the freestream nut is set to a small value, like 1e-5, but the exact value depends on the model setup.\n\nBut given the user's instruction to convert non-dimensional parameters to field values, perhaps the nut's freestream is not directly calculated but derived from the model. However, the user wants the initial and boundary conditions as per the provided JSON structure. The JSON specifies that nut in the inlet/outlet is \"freestream\", which would correspond to the computed nut value based on nuTilda and the S-A model. But in practice, for the boundary conditions, nuTilda is set to 3ν, and nut is derived.\n\nBut the user's JSON specifies the boundary types, and we need to provide the values. The initial conditions for U would be 52.08 m/s in the x-direction. Pressure initial could be 0. nuTilda initial is 2.604e-05. nut initial would be 1.827e-06.\n\nSo the JSON would look like:\n\n{\n  \"initial\": {\n    \"U\": {\"value\": [52.08, 0, 0], \"type\": \"uniform\"},\n    \"p\": {\"value\": 0, \"type\": \"uniform\"},\n    \"nuTilda\": {\"value\": 2.604e-05, \"type\": \"uniform\"},\n    \"nut\": {\"value\": 1.827e-06, \"type\": \"uniform\"}\n  },\n  \"boundary\": {\n    \"airfoil\": {\n      \"U\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": [0, 0, 0]},\n      \"p\": {\"type\": \"zeroGradient\"},\n      \"nuTilda\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": 0},\n      \"nut\": {\"type\": \"nutLowReWallFunction\"}\n    },\n    \"inlet\": {\n      \"U\": {\"type\": \"freestreamVelocity\", \"value\": [52.08, 0, 0]},\n      \"p\": {\"type\": \"freestreamPressure\", \"value\": 0},\n      \"nuTilda\": {\"type\": \"freestream\", \"value\": 2.604e-05},\n      \"nut\": {\"type\": \"freestream\", \"value\": 1.827e-06}\n    },\n    \"outlet\": {\n      \"U\": {\"type\": \"freestreamVelocity\", \"value\": [52.08, 0, 0]},\n      \"p\": {\"type\": \"freestreamPressure\", \"value\": 0},\n      \"nuTilda\": {\"type\": \"freestream\", \"value\": 2.604e-05},\n      \"nut\": {\"type\": \"freestream\", \"value\": 1.827e-06}\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nBut I need to ensure that the boundary types in the JSON match exactly what the user provided. The user's JSON specifies \"freestreamVelocity\" and \"freestreamPressure\" as types, but in OpenFOAM, these might correspond to \"fixedValue\" with a uniform value. However, the user's boundary types are given as \"freestreamVelocity\", \"freestreamPressure\", and \"freestream\" for nuTilda and nut. Wait, the user's JSON has:\n\ninlet: U=freestreamVelocity, p=freestreamPressure, nuTilda=freestream, nut=freestream\n\nBut in OpenFOAM, there's no boundary condition named \"freestreamVelocity\". Instead, for incompressible flows, the inlet velocity is typically set using \"fixedValue\" with a uniform value. The term \"freestream\" might refer to using the freestream value defined in the turbulence model. However, the user's instruction says to strictly follow the provided list of boundary types, which includes types like \"freestreamVelocity\". This suggests that the user expects these to be OpenFOAM-specific boundary condition types. But in reality, OpenFOAM uses \"fixedValue\" for velocity with a uniform value, \"inletOutlet\" for outlets, or other types. There's a possibility that the user provided a simplified version, and \"freestreamVelocity\" is equivalent to \"fixedValue\" with the freestream velocity value.\n\nBut according to the user's strict instruction, the JSON must use the exact boundary types listed. Therefore, even if \"freestreamVelocity\" isn't a standard OpenFOAM type, we have to use it as per the user's example. This might be a misunderstanding, but the user insists not to change any boundary type in the list. So the JSON must use the types as given: \"freestreamVelocity\", \"freestreamPressure\", \"freestream\", etc.\n\nThus, the final JSON should have the boundary types exactly as specified, with the values converted from the given flow parameters. The key is to set the correct velocity magnitude based on Ma=0.15 and Re=6e6, then compute nuTilda and nut accordingly.\n\nAnother check: the airfoil's nuTilda is set to fixedValue with 0, which is correct for walls in the S-A model (nuTilda=0 on walls). The nut uses nutLowReWallFunction, which automatically handles the wall treatment.\n\nIn summary, the initial and boundary conditions are set with U=52.08 m/s, p=0, nuTilda=2.604e-05, nut=1.827e-06. The boundaries follow the user's specified types with these values.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to set up an OpenFOAM case for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil using simpleFoam and the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. They provided specific initial and boundary conditions in JSON format and mentioned that the grid is already prepared. The task is to generate all necessary case files in the correct OpenFOAM format without any markdown, just pure JSON.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the required files based on the user's list: controlDict, U, p, nuTilda, fvSchemes, turbulenceProperties, fvSolution, and nut. Each of these files needs to be structured according to OpenFOAM's syntax, including the FoamFile header but excluding the auto-generated comments.\n\nStarting with system/controlDict. The application should be simpleFoam, and since it's a steady-state simulation, the startFrom and stopAt settings should be correct. The writeInterval and other parameters need to be set as per standard practice. The libraries entry for the turbulence model is crucial here.\n\nNext, the 0/U file. The initial value is given as [52.08, 0, 0], and the boundary conditions include fixedValue for the airfoil and freestreamVelocity for inlet/outlet. The airfoil wall has a no-slip condition, so U is set to zero there. The dimensions for velocity are [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0].\n\nThe constant/transportProperties file needs to specify the kinematic viscosity. The user provided Re=6e6, and with Mach 0.15, but since it's incompressible, Mach number might not directly affect viscosity. Using the formula nu = (Mach * speed of sound * chord length)/Re, but maybe the user provided the initial nuTilda and nut values directly. Here, transportProperties should have nu [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 1.5e-05, but need to cross-check with the given initial conditions. Wait, the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-05 and nut is 1.83e-06. But in the Spalart-Allmaras model, nuTilda is the modified viscosity. The actual kinematic viscosity (nu) is separate. The transportProperties should set the laminar viscosity, which is a separate parameter. So nu in transportProperties is the molecular viscosity, which for air at standard conditions is around 1.5e-05 m²/s. But the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-05, which is the initial field for the SA model variable. So the transportProperties nu should be set correctly, perhaps 1.5e-05, but need to confirm based on the Reynolds number. Re = 6e6, chord length c=1m, velocity U=52.08 m/s. So nu = U*c/Re = 52.08 * 1 / 6e6 ≈ 8.68e-06 m²/s. Wait, but the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-05, which is different. Hmm, perhaps the user has a specific setup. But in the transportProperties, nu is the actual laminar viscosity. So if Re=6e6, U=52.08, c=1, then nu=52.08/(6e6) ≈ 8.68e-06. However, the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-05. But the SA model uses nuTilda as the working variable. The transportProperties nu is the molecular viscosity. So in the transportProperties, nu should be set to 8.68e-06. But the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-05. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps the initial values are based on a different calculation. Alternatively, maybe the given initial values are correct as per their setup. But according to the problem statement, the user provided the initial conditions in the JSON, so I should use those. Wait, the transportProperties nu is separate from the SA model's nuTilda. So in the constant/transportProperties, the nu should be the molecular kinematic viscosity. Given Re=6e6, U=52.08 m/s, chord=1m, nu= U*c/Re = 52.08/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-06 m²/s. But the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-05. However, in the SA model, nuTilda is initialized to a certain value, often similar to the molecular viscosity. Maybe the user has a different approach, but according to the problem statement, I should follow their given initial conditions. Wait, no: the transportProperties 'nu' is the laminar kinematic viscosity, which is a physical property, while nuTilda is the SA model's variable. So the transportProperties nu must be set based on the Reynolds number. Let me recalculate: Re = (U * c)/nu → nu = U*c/Re = 52.08 * 1 / 6e6 ≈ 8.68e-06 m²/s. Therefore, in constant/transportProperties, nu should be 8.68e-06. But the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-05. That's okay because nuTilda is a modified viscosity variable in the SA model. So in the transportProperties, nu is 8.68e-06. However, the user's JSON initial for nuTilda is 2.6e-05. So I need to set transportProperties nu to 8.68e-06. But how does that align with the user's given data? Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial conditions, but according to the problem statement, I must strictly follow their JSON. Let me check the JSON again. The initial values are U: [52.08,0,0], p:0, nuTilda:2.6e-05, nut:1.83e-06. The transportProperties nu is the molecular viscosity, which should be calculated correctly. If Re=6e6, then nu=52.08/(6e6)= ~8.68e-06. But the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-05, which is higher. That might be okay because the SA model's nuTilda is a modified viscosity. So in the transportProperties, set nu to 8.68e-06. However, the user didn't mention this, but they provided the initial conditions. Wait, the user's JSON doesn't mention transportProperties, so I have to calculate it based on Re. But the user's problem statement says to follow the initial and boundary conditions strictly. Therefore, I need to set the transportProperties nu correctly based on Re=6e6, U=52.08, chord=1. So nu=52.08/(6e6)=8.68e-06. Therefore, in constant/transportProperties, nu is 8.68e-06. But the user's initial nuTilda is 2.6e-05. That's acceptable because nuTilda is a different variable. So proceed with that.\n\nMoving on to 0/nuTilda. The initial value is 2.6e-05, and the boundary conditions are fixedValue 0 on the airfoil, freestream at inlet/outlet with 2.6e-05. The dimensions for nuTilda in the SA model are [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0], same as kinematic viscosity.\n\nFor 0/p, the initial value is 0, with zeroGradient on the airfoil and freestreamPressure at inlet/outlet. Dimensions are [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0].\n\nThe system/fvSchemes needs to be set for simpleFoam. Typically, Gauss linear for grad, div, laplacian schemes. For div(phi,U), use Gauss linearUpwind grad(U). The ddtSchemes are steadyState.\n\nIn constant/turbulenceProperties, the simulationType is RAS, RASModel is SpalartAllmaras, turbulence is on, printCoeffs is on.\n\nThe system/fvSolution contains the solvers and relaxation factors. For simpleFoam, the solvers for U, p, nuTilda, and potentialFlow are set with appropriate tolerances. The SIMPLE algorithm parameters like nNonOrthogonalCorrectors and relaxation factors are included.\n\n0/nut is the turbulent viscosity field. The initial value is 1.83e-06, with nutLowReWallFunction on the airfoil and freestream elsewhere. Dimensions are [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0].\n\nNow, I need to ensure all the boundary conditions in each file match the JSON provided. For example, the airfoil's U is fixedValue [0 0 0], p is zeroGradient, nuTilda is fixedValue 0, and nut is nutLowReWallFunction. Inlet and outlet have freestreamVelocity for U, freestreamPressure for p, and freestream for nuTilda and nut with their respective values.\n\nAlso, check that the FoamFile headers have the correct class and object names. For example, in 0/U, the class is volVectorField, object is U. For controlDict, the class is dictionary, object is controlDict.\n\nAnother thing to verify is the application entry in controlDict. It must be simpleFoam, and the libraries entry should include the incompressible turbulence models.\n\nFinally, ensure that all files are structured correctly without any markdown, and the JSON response strictly contains the file paths as keys and their contents as values in string format, including the FoamFile headers but excluding the auto-generated comments.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error because the keyword 'viscosityModel' is undefined in the transportProperties dictionary. The error points to line 9 in that file.\n\nLooking at the provided transportProperties file content, it only has 'nu' defined with a value and dimensions. The OpenFOAM tutorials I remember usually include a 'transportModel' entry, like Newtonian, before specifying 'nu'. So, the solver might be expecting the 'viscosityModel' keyword, which could be the same as 'transportModel' here.\n\nWait, in some versions or solvers, maybe the keyword is 'transportModel' instead of 'viscosityModel'. The error says 'viscosityModel' is missing, but the sample files from the tutorials use 'transportModel'. That might be the issue. The user's file doesn't have the 'transportModel' entry, so the solver is looking for it under a different name, hence the error.\n\nSo the fix should be adding the 'transportModel' line. Let me check the sample files provided. For example, sample_file_8 has 'transportModel Newtonian;' followed by 'nu'. The user's file only has 'nu'. Therefore, adding 'transportModel Newtonian;' before the 'nu' entry should resolve the missing keyword error.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned not altering the initial and boundary conditions. Since adding the transportModel doesn't affect those values, it's safe. The 'nu' value in their file is 8.68e-06, which should remain as is. The dimensions for 'nu' look correct (m²/s, which is [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0]).\n\nSo the corrected transportProperties file should include both 'transportModel' and 'nu' entries. The order might matter, so transportModel first. Let me make sure the syntax is correct with a semicolon and proper placement. Yes, the samples have transportModel first. Therefore, inserting 'transportModel Newtonian;' right after the FoamFile header and before 'nu' should fix the error without violating any initial or boundary conditions.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on with this OpenFOAM error. The error message says that the keyword 'wallDist' is undefined in the fvSchemes dictionary. Hmm, so the problem is in the system/fvSchemes file. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the fvSchemes file does. It's where the numerical schemes for different terms (like gradients, divergence, etc.) are defined. The error mentions that 'wallDist' is missing. Wait, wallDist is related to the wall distance calculation, which is necessary for certain turbulence models, especially Spalart-Allmaras, which is being used here according to the turbulenceProperties file.\n\nThe Spalart-Allmaras model requires the wall distance to compute the eddy viscosity. OpenFOAM usually handles this by generating a wallDist field, but maybe the fvSchemes needs to have a specific entry for it. Looking at the provided fvSchemes content, there's no mention of wallDist in any of the schemes. \n\nIn OpenFOAM, when using models that require wall distance, the fvSchemes should include a section for wallDist. The correct setup might be adding a wallDist scheme under the laplacianSchemes. For example, specifying Gauss linear corrected for the laplacian(nuTilda,wallDist) term. So the fix would be to add a line in the laplacianSchemes section for wallDist.\n\nTherefore, the user needs to modify the system/fvSchemes file by adding the wallDist entry under laplacianSchemes. That should resolve the missing keyword error.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error saying that the keyword 'wallDist' is undefined in their fvSchemes file. The error points to lines 11 to 37 in the fvSchemes dictionary. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided fvSchemes content. The user's current fvSchemes doesn't have a 'wallDist' section. Checking the sample files from the tutorials, like sample_file_10 and sample_file_1, they both include a 'wallDist' entry with 'method meshWave;'. So, the error is because OpenFOAM expects the 'wallDist' keyword in fvSchemes but it's missing.\n\nThe task is to correct this without altering initial or boundary conditions. The solution is to add the missing 'wallDist' section. The correct entry from the samples is 'wallDist { method meshWave; }'. \n\nSo, the fix is to append this block to the user's fvSchemes file. I need to make sure that the addition doesn't interfere with other existing sections. Since the user's file ends with 'snGradSchemes', adding 'wallDist' after that should work. \n\nI should check if there are any other missing sections, but based on the error, only 'wallDist' is the issue. The user's initial and boundary conditions aren't affected by this change. The tutorials use 'meshWave' method, which is likely required for the turbulence model being used, like SA (Spalart-Allmaras), which depends on wall distance.\n\nTherefore, the step-by-step fix is to add the wallDist section with the meshWave method to the fvSchemes file.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error because the keyword 'div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U)))))' is undefined in their fvSchemes file. I need to figure out why this is happening and how to fix it without messing up their initial and boundary conditions.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided fvSchemes content, the divSchemes section has entries for 'div(phi,U)' and the default is 'none'. The error mentions that the specific divergence scheme for 'nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U)))' is missing. In OpenFOAM, especially when using certain turbulence models like Spalart-Allmaras (SA), there are additional divergence terms that need to be defined in the fvSchemes. The SA model might require this term to be handled properly in the numerical schemes.\n\nChecking the sample files from the tutorials, like sample_file_16, they include this exact line in divSchemes. So the solution is to add that missing entry. The user's current fvSchemes doesn't have it, which is why the error occurs. \n\nThe next step is to modify the divSchemes section by adding 'div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U))))) Gauss linear;' as seen in the tutorials. This should resolve the undefined keyword error. Also, looking at the samples, some use 'bounded' keyword, but since the user's current setup doesn't have it for 'div(phi,U)', maybe it's better to follow the tutorial's example without adding 'bounded' unless necessary. However, the sample_file_16 uses 'bounded Gauss linearUpwind' for 'div(phi,U)' and 'div(phi,nuTilda)', but the user's current setup has 'Gauss linearUpwind grad(U)' without 'bounded'. Since the user's initial conditions and boundary setup might rely on the existing schemes, adding the missing line without altering existing entries should be safe.\n\nSo the correction is straightforward: insert the missing divergence scheme for the nuEff term. That should make the simulation recognize the keyword and proceed without the fatal error.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user provided an OpenFOAM runtime error and the case files in JSON format. The error message says that the keyword 'smoother' is undefined in the dictionary for the pressure solver in the fvSolution file.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the system/fvSolution entry from the case files. The solver for 'p' is using GAMG. In OpenFOAM, when using GAMG, you need to specify a smoother if you're using a smoother-based method. But the current entry under 'p' doesn't have a 'smoother' keyword. That's probably why it's throwing an error because GAMG requires certain parameters like smoother or agglomerator.\n\nLooking at the provided system/fvSolution, the 'p' solver has solver GAMG, tolerance, and relTol, but no smoother. The error is pointing to lines 13-15 in that section. So the fix would be to add the 'smoother' keyword to the 'p' solver in fvSolution. Common smoothers for GAMG are Gauss-Seidel, DICGaussSeidel, or others depending on the case. Maybe the user should add something like 'smoother GaussSeidel;' or another appropriate smoother.\n\nThe wrong file is definitely system/fvSolution. The advice should guide the user to add the smoother entry under the p solver in that file. Also, check if other parameters like agglomeration or cacheAgglomeration are needed, but the error is specifically about the smoother, so focusing on that first.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's take a look at these three errors the user provided. The question is whether the same error has occurred three times. The user wants to know if any of the errors are repetitive, meaning the exact same error message appeared three times.\n\nFirst, let's break down each error to understand what they're about.\n\nError 1: The keyword 'smoother' is undefined in the fvSolution/solvers/p dictionary. The file path is specified, and it's pointing to lines 13-15. The error comes from the dictionary lookup in the OpenFOAM code.\n\nError 2: The keyword 'div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U)))))' is undefined in the fvSchemes/divSchemes dictionary. This is in a different file, fvSchemes, lines 21-22. The same function in dictionary.C is mentioned, but the missing keyword here is related to divergence schemes.\n\nError 3: The keyword 'wallDist' is undefined in the fvSchemes dictionary, which is again a different part of the system files. This error is from the subDict function in the same file but a different line. The missing keyword here is 'wallDist'.\n\nNow, the key is to check if any of these errors are the same. Each error is about a missing keyword in different dictionaries and different files. The first error is about 'smoother' in fvSolution, the second about a specific div scheme in fvSchemes, and the third about 'wallDist' in another part of fvSchemes. The error messages themselves are different in terms of the missing keywords and the specific dictionaries involved. Even though all three are fatal IO errors in OpenFOAM, each one is caused by a different missing entry. Therefore, none of the errors are repeating the same issue three times. They are three distinct errors.\n",

Let me look at their provided fvSolution contents.\n\nLooking at the solvers section for 'p', they have GAMG as the solver but no 'smoother' entry. The error says 'smoother' is undefined, so that's the issue. GAMG requires a smoother to be specified. \n\nIn the sample files they provided, like sample_file_4, the 'p' solver under GAMG includes 'smoother GaussSeidel;'. So the fix is to add the smoother keyword to the 'p' solver. \n\nBut wait, what's the correct smoother for GAMG? Common ones are GaussSeidel, DICGaussSeidel, etc. The samples use GaussSeidel, so that's a safe choice. Also, check if other parameters like tolerance or relTol need adjustment, but the error is specifically about the missing 'smoother'.\n\nThe user also mentioned not altering initial and boundary conditions. Since this change is in the solver settings, it shouldn't affect those conditions. So the step-by-step fix is to add 'smoother GaussSeidel;' under the 'p' solver in fvSolution.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error because the keyword 'div(phi,nuTilda)' is undefined in the divSchemes section of their fvSchemes file. The error message points to lines 21-23 in the divSchemes dictionary. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current contents of their fvSchemes. Looking at their divSchemes, they have entries for div(phi,U) and div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U))))), but nothing for nuTilda. Since they're using the Spalart-Allmaras model (SA), the turbulence variable is nuTilda, so the div scheme for it must be defined.\n\nThe sample files from the tutorials (like sample_file_16) show that for SA, there's a line like 'div(phi,nuTilda) bounded Gauss linearUpwind grad(nuTilda);'. That's missing here. The error occurs because OpenFOAM expects this entry when the SA model is active.\n\nThe fix would be to add the missing div(phi,nuTilda) entry. The user's current divSchemes uses 'Gauss linearUpwind grad(U)' for U, so for nuTilda, a similar approach with grad(nuTilda) makes sense. The tutorial examples use 'bounded Gauss linearUpwind grad(nuTilda)', so including 'bounded' might be necessary for stability.\n\nI should make sure that adding this entry doesn't alter the initial or boundary conditions, which the user specified must remain unchanged. Since the fvSchemes don't affect initial/boundary values directly, this addition is safe.\n\nSo, the step-by-step fix is to edit the divSchemes section by inserting the line 'div(phi,nuTilda) bounded Gauss linearUpwind grad(nuTilda);' right after the existing entries. This should resolve the undefined keyword error.\n",
