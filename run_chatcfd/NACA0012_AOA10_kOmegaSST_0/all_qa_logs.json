    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to convert a JSON string into a specific Markdown format. The main points are that each top-level key becomes a main heading, and the key-value pairs under it become unordered list items. Also, the hierarchy should be maintained in the list format.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the provided JSON. The JSON has a top-level key \"Case_AOA10_kOmegaSST\". Under that, there are several keys like \"case_name\", \"solver\", etc. Each of these should be list items under the main heading.\n\nSo the main heading will be \"# Case_AOA10_kOmegaSST\". Then, each sub-key and value will be a bullet point. For example, \"- **case_name**: NACA0012_AOA10_kOmegaSST\".\n\nWait, I need to make sure that each key-value pair is rendered as an unordered list item. The keys should probably be bolded, using double asterisks. The values are just plain text after the colon.\n\nLet me check the example given. The user provided a sample input and wants the corresponding Markdown. Let me reconstruct the correct structure.\n\nOriginal JSON structure:\n{\n    \"Case_AOA10_kOmegaSST\": {\n        \"key1\": \"value1\",\n        \"key2\": \"value2\",\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nIn Markdown, this should be:\n\n# Case_AOA10_kOmegaSST\n\n- **key1**: value1\n- **key2**: value2\n...\n\nYes, that makes sense. So each top-level key is a main heading (with #), and each sub-key is a list item with the key in bold followed by the value.\n\nI also need to ensure that there are no extra levels. Since the JSON provided has only two levels (the top key and its children), the Markdown should reflect that with a main heading and a list. There's no deeper hierarchy here, so no sub-lists needed.\n\nChecking the specific example given:\n\nThe \"case_specific_description\" value is a long sentence. In Markdown, it should still be a single list item. No line breaks unless necessary, but since it's a single string, it should stay as is.\n\nSo the final Markdown would look like:\n\n# Case_AOA10_kOmegaSST\n\n- **case_name**: NACA0012_AOA10_kOmegaSST\n- **solver**: simpleFoam\n- **turbulence_model**: kOmegaSST\n- **other_physical_model**: incompressible\n- **case_specific_description**: Steady-state simulation... (rest of the text)\n\nI need to make sure there's a space after the colon and that each list item starts with a hyphen and a space. Also, the main heading should have a space after the #. No trailing spaces or extra characters.\n\nYes, that should cover all the requirements. Let me put it all together correctly.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract boundary conditions from the provided paper excerpts and correct any spelling errors in the boundary type names based on the OpenFOAM boundary name list they provided. They specifically mention the boundaries for 'outlet', 'inlet', and 'airfoil' and fields 'nut', 'U', 'omega', 'p', 'k'. \n\nFirst, I need to find where the boundary conditions are described in the paper. Looking at the excerpts, on Page 4, Table 1 lists the boundary conditions used in OpenFOAM. The table mentions boundaries: Airfoil, Inlet/outlet, Front and back. The fields are U, p, nuTilda, and nut. \n\nThe user specified to correct spelling but not change the boundary types. The OpenFOAM boundary list includes 'freestreamVelocity' and 'freestreamPressure'. In the paper, the Inlet/outlet uses 'freestream velocity' and 'freestreamPressure'. 'freestream' is a valid boundary type in OpenFOAM, so 'freestream velocity' should be corrected to 'freestreamVelocity' as per the list. Similarly, 'freestreamPressure' is correct.\n\nFor the Airfoil boundary, the paper uses 'fixed-value' for U and 'nutLowReWallFunction' for nut. Checking the OpenFOAM list, 'fixedValue' is correct, but the table has 'fixed-value' with a hyphen. So correct to 'fixedValue'. 'nutLowReWallFunction' is valid. The 'noSlip' condition is mentioned for the airfoil wall, which is in the OpenFOAM list. The 'front and back' boundaries are listed as 'empty', which is valid.\n\nThe user also wants boundaries divided if they have a slash. The 'Inlet/outlet' should be split into 'inlet' and 'outlet' separately. For each field, check the boundary types. For example, 'U' at inlet uses 'freestreamVelocity', which is correct. The 'outlet' would also use 'freestream' conditions. The 'airfoil' (solid wall) uses 'noSlip' and 'nutLowReWallFunction'.\n\nNow, mapping each boundary and field correctly, ensuring spelling matches the OpenFOAM list. The final JSON should list each boundary (inlet, outlet, airfoil) with their respective fields and corrected boundary types.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the initial and boundary conditions for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil case using OpenFOAM-v2406 with the kOmegaSST model. The user provided a JSON structure that I must follow strictly without changing any boundary types. Let me go through the paper excerpts again to extract the necessary parameters.\n\nFirst, the paper mentions a Mach number of 0.15 and Reynolds number of 6e6 based on chord length. The ambient temperature is 300 K. The solver is simpleFoam, which is for steady-state, incompressible flows. So I need to convert these non-dimensional parameters into actual field values for OpenFOAM.\n\nFor the inlet and outlet boundary conditions, the JSON specifies \"freestreamVelocity\" for U and \"freestreamPressure\" for p. Since it's incompressible, pressure is kinematic (divided by density). The freestream pressure is likely zero gradient, but the JSON says \"freestreamPressure\" which I think refers to a fixed value. Wait, in simpleFoam, pressure is often set as zero gradient at inlet/outlet, but the user's JSON has \"freestreamPressure\" which might be a fixed value. However, the paper's Table 1 shows p as zero gradient at the airfoil wall and freestreamPressure at inlet/outlet. But the user's JSON structure for inlet/outlet has p as \"freestreamPressure\", which probably means a fixedValue. Wait, in OpenFOAM, for incompressible, pressure is often set with zero gradient at inlet and fixedValue at outlet, but the user's structure might be different. Need to check.\n\nThe Reynolds number is Re=6e6, chord length c=1.0 m (since it's dimensionless but the actual simulation needs physical units). The Mach number Ma=0.15. The temperature is 300 K. Let's compute the velocity.\n\nFirst, compute the speed of sound: a = sqrt(gamma*R*T). For air, gamma=1.4, R=287 J/kg·K. So a = sqrt(1.4*287*300) ≈ sqrt(1.4*86100) ≈ sqrt(120540) ≈ 347.2 m/s. Then, freestream velocity U_inf = Ma * a = 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s.\n\nReynolds number Re = (rho * U_inf * c)/mu. We need to find mu (dynamic viscosity). But Re is given as 6e6, so rearranging to find mu: mu = (rho * U_inf * c)/Re. However, for incompressible, rho is constant. Assuming ideal gas, but since it's incompressible, rho is constant. Wait, simpleFoam is for incompressible, so rho is uniform and constant. The paper doesn't specify rho, but standard air at 300 K has rho ≈ 1.225 kg/m³. Let's confirm with R = 287 J/kg·K, p = rho*R*T. If ambient pressure is 1 atm (101325 Pa), then rho = p/(R*T) = 101325/(287*300) ≈ 101325/86100 ≈ 1.176 kg/m³. So using rho=1.176 kg/m³.\n\nThen, mu = (rho * U_inf * c)/Re = (1.176 * 52.08 * 1.0)/6e6 ≈ (61.25)/6e6 ≈ 1.0208e-5 Pa·s. Kinematic viscosity nu = mu/rho ≈ 1.0208e-5 / 1.176 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, the kinematic viscosity nu is used. The turbulence model kOmegaSST requires nut (eddy viscosity), which is initialized. The initial conditions for U would be 52.08 m/s in the freestream direction (probably x-direction), p is zero (since incompressible uses kinematic pressure, where p = (static pressure - reference pressure)/rho), but initial pressure is often set to zero. For turbulence fields, k and omega need to be initialized. The user didn't mention k and omega, but since the JSON only asks for U, p, and nut, perhaps the other fields are handled elsewhere. But the user's question is about the initial and boundary conditions as per the provided JSON structure.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the airfoil (wall) are no-slip for U, zeroGradient for p, and nutLowReWallFunction for nut. For inlet and outlet, U is freestreamVelocity (fixedValue), p is freestreamPressure (maybe fixedValue 0?), and nut is freestream (turbulent viscosity in freestream, which for kOmegaSST, the freestream nut can be zero if the flow is fully turbulent, but maybe calculated from the turbulence intensity and viscosity ratio).\n\nWait, the original paper uses the S-A model and their own model. But the user wants to use kOmegaSST. However, the boundary conditions in the JSON are fixed. The user wants to know the values for U, p, and nut based on the flow parameters (Ma=0.15, Re=6e6, T=300K).\n\nSo converting Mach 0.15 to velocity as 52.08 m/s. The pressure in incompressible is kinematic, so if the reference pressure is atmospheric (101325 Pa), then p = 0 (since p = (P - P_ref)/rho). So initial and freestream pressure would be 0. For nut, in the freestream, if the flow is considered fully turbulent, nut can be calculated as nut = nu_tilda (for S-A), but for kOmegaSST, the freestream nut is typically a small value or based on turbulence intensity. However, the user's JSON specifies \"freestream\" for nut at inlet/outlet, which in OpenFOAM terms is usually a fixedValue with a calculated value. Alternatively, it might be a freestream turbulence viscosity. Since the user wants to follow the structure strictly, perhaps the nut in the freestream is set to a value derived from Re and Ma. But the paper doesn't specify turbulence intensity. However, in the absence of specific turbulence parameters, a common approach is to set a small turbulent viscosity ratio. For example, turbulent viscosity ratio (nu_t/nu) could be set to 10 or similar. But the user's case is a low-speed flow, so maybe the freestream turbulence is low. Let's assume a turbulence intensity of 0.1% and a viscosity ratio of 10. Then, nut = nu_t = (nu_t/nu) * nu = 10 * 8.68e-6 ≈ 8.68e-5 m²/s. But this is a guess. However, the paper doesn't provide specifics on turbulence parameters, so I need to make assumptions based on standard practices. Alternatively, since the original paper used S-A and the new model, but the user is using kOmegaSST, the nut boundary conditions might need to be adjusted. However, the JSON structure provided by the user specifies \"nut\" for inlet/outlet as \"freestream\", which in OpenFOAM's boundary conditions for kOmegaSST would typically use a calculated or fixedValue based on turbulence model parameters. But the user's JSON structure seems to use \"freestream\" as a keyword, which might correspond to a fixedValue with a specific value. Since the user insists on strictly following the provided JSON structure, and the original paper's boundary conditions (Table 1) for nut at inlet/outlet is \"freestream\" (which in their case, for S-A model, nuTilda is set to freestream value), perhaps for kOmegaSST, the nut at inlet/outlet is set to a value derived from the turbulence model's freestream conditions. However, without specific turbulence parameters like turbulence intensity or length scale, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nAlternatively, since the flow is at Re=6e6, which is high, and the paper uses wall-resolved LES (but no, it's RANS). For kOmegaSST, the inlet turbulence quantities can be estimated using formulas. For example, turbulence intensity I = 0.1% (0.001), then turbulent kinetic energy k = 1.5*(U*I)^2 = 1.5*(52.08*0.001)^2 ≈ 1.5*(0.05208)^2 ≈ 0.00407 m²/s². Specific dissipation rate omega can be estimated using omega = (k^0.5)/(Cmu^0.25 * L), where Cmu=0.09, and L is turbulence length scale. Assuming L = 0.07*chord_length = 0.07*1 = 0.07 m, then omega = sqrt(0.00407)/(0.09^0.25 * 0.07) ≈ 0.0638 / (0.547 * 0.07) ≈ 0.0638 / 0.0383 ≈ 1.665 rad/s. Then, nut = k/(omega) ≈ 0.00407 / 1.665 ≈ 0.00244 m²/s. But this is for k and omega. However, the user's JSON only asks for nut. Alternatively, in OpenFOAM, the freestream nut for kOmegaSST can be calculated as nut = 0.14 * nu (assuming a default viscosity ratio). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the user's case is similar to the original paper which used S-A model with nuTilda set to freestream (probably 3*nu or similar), maybe for nut in kOmegaSST, set it to a small value like 1e-5 m²/s. But this is uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the original paper's boundary conditions (Table 1), for the S-A model, nuTilda is set to fixedValue at inlet/outlet with freestream values. The nut for the new model is set to freestream. The user's JSON structure for nut at inlet/outlet is \"freestream\", which in OpenFOAM terms for the S-A model would be a fixedValue with a calculated nuTilda. But for kOmegaSST, nut is derived from k and omega. However, the user's JSON structure seems to require specific values for U, p, and nut. Since the user wants to follow the structure strictly, perhaps the nut at inlet/outlet is set to a fixedValue of 0, but that's not correct. Alternatively, in the original paper, the freestream nut might be computed based on the turbulence model. For the S-A model, the freestream nuTilda is typically set to a small value, like 0.1*nu. But without explicit information, this is tricky.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the information I have. The key parameters are:\n\n- U_inlet = 52.08 m/s (x-direction)\n- p = 0 (kinematic pressure)\n- nu = 8.68e-6 m²/s\n- Re = 6e6\n- Ma = 0.15\n\nFor nut in the freestream, assuming low turbulence, maybe set nut to a small value like 1e-5 m²/s. But I need to ensure that the turbulent viscosity ratio (nut/nu) is reasonable. For example, if nut = 1e-5, then ratio is 1e-5 / 8.68e-6 ≈ 1.15, which is plausible for a low turbulence case. Alternatively, if the turbulence intensity is very low, nut could be zero, but that's not realistic. \n\nTherefore, the initial conditions would be:\n\n- U: (52.08 0 0) m/s\n- p: 0\n- nut: 1e-5 m²/s (freestream value)\n\nFor the airfoil wall, nut uses nutLowReWallFunction, which automatically computes the near-wall turbulence.\n\nSo compiling this into the JSON structure as per the user's request, the final answer should have:\n\n- Inlet and outlet U as fixedValue (52.08 m/s in x-direction)\n- Inlet and outlet p as fixedValue 0\n- Inlet and outlet nut as fixedValue 1e-5\n- Airfoil U as noSlip (zero velocity)\n- Airfoil p as zeroGradient\n- Airfoil nut as nutLowReWallFunction\n\nBut the user's JSON structure uses keywords like \"freestreamVelocity\" and \"freestreamPressure\", which in OpenFOAM are typically implemented with fixedValue and a uniform value. So translating that:\n\n- Inlet and outlet U: fixedValue (52.08 0 0)\n- Inlet and outlet p: fixedValue 0\n- Inlet and outlet nut: fixedValue 1e-5\n\nBut the user's JSON specifies \"freestreamVelocity\" and \"freestreamPressure\", which might be OpenFOAM patches or using a function like freestream. However, in the context of the user's JSON, \"freestreamVelocity\" likely refers to a fixedValue with the calculated velocity, and similarly for pressure. The user might have specific names in mind, but since the JSON structure is given, I'll map \"freestreamVelocity\" to the actual velocity value and \"freestreamPressure\" to the pressure value.\n\nThus, the final JSON would have:\n\n- \"U\" at inlet/outlet set to the calculated velocity (52.08 m/s in x)\n- \"p\" at inlet/outlet set to 0\n- \"nut\" at inlet/outlet set to a small value like 1e-5\n\nBut wait, in the original paper's boundary conditions (Table 1), for the S-A model, the inlet/outlet for U is fixedValue with freestream velocity, p is freestreamPressure (which in the paper's case is zero gradient?), but the user's JSON says \"freestreamPressure\" for p at inlet/outlet, which in OpenFOAM for simpleFoam is usually zero gradient for inlet and fixedValue for outlet. But the user's structure has \"freestreamPressure\" for both, which might mean fixedValue 0. Since the user insists on not changing the boundary types, I'll follow that.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"initialConditions\": {\n        \"U\": [52.08, 0, 0],\n        \"p\": 0,\n        \"nut\": 1e-5\n    },\n    \"boundaryConditions\": {\n        \"inlet\": {\n            \"U\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": [52.08, 0, 0]},\n            \"p\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": 0},\n            \"nut\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": 1e-5}\n        },\n        \"outlet\": {\n            \"U\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": [52.08, 0, 0]},\n            \"p\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": 0},\n            \"nut\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": 1e-5}\n        },\n        \"airfoil\": {\n            \"U\": {\"type\": \"noSlip\"},\n            \"p\": {\"type\": \"zeroGradient\"},\n            \"nut\": {\"type\": \"nutLowReWallFunction\"}\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the user provided a JSON structure with \"freestreamVelocity\", \"freestreamPressure\", and \"freestream\" as values, not types. Wait, the user's example JSON has:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"boundaryConditions\": {\n        \"inlet\": {\n            \"U\": \"freestreamVelocity\",\n            \"p\": \"freestreamPressure\",\n            \"nut\": \"freestream\"\n        },\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo the user expects the values to be set as \"freestreamVelocity\", etc., but in OpenFOAM, these are implemented with specific boundary types and values. However, the user probably wants the actual numerical values based on the flow parameters. The user's instruction says: \"Convert these flow parameters to the field values.\" So the \"freestreamVelocity\" should be replaced with the actual velocity value, \"freestreamPressure\" with the actual pressure value, and \"freestream\" for nut with the actual turbulent viscosity value.\n\nTherefore, the correct JSON should replace the placeholders with numerical values:\n\n- \"U\" at inlet/outlet: 52.08 m/s in x-direction\n- \"p\" at inlet/outlet: 0 (since it's kinematic pressure)\n- \"nut\" at inlet/outlet: 1e-5 m²/s (assuming a small turbulent viscosity)\n\nThus, the final JSON is as follows.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted.

It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2.

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident. This paper used the structured mesh of 897×257\\nfor subsequent calculation, with the airfoil wall y + <1.0.\\nFigure 1: Computational domain of NACA0012 airfoil\\nFigure 2: Computational domain grid\\nFigure 3: Computational grid near NACA0012 airfoil Figure\\nPage 6:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 4: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient\\nThe boundary conditions are inlet boundary, outlet boundary, solid wall boundary, and empty\\nboundary.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack.

Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to set up an OpenFOAM case for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil using the k-Omega SST model with specific initial and boundary conditions. They provided a JSON structure that needs to be strictly followed. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the necessary files for an OpenFOAM case. The key files mentioned are in the 0/, system/, and constant/ directories. For the k-Omega SST model, the 0 directory should include k, omega, nut, p, and U files. The system directory requires controlDict, fvSchemes, fvSolution, and maybe others. The constant directory needs turbulenceProperties and transportProperties.\n\nStarting with the 0 files. The user specified initial conditions: U is [52.08, 0, 0], p is 0, and nut is 8.68e-6. The boundary conditions for inlet, outlet, and airfoil must be set accordingly. For the airfoil, U is no-slip (fixedValue [0 0 0]), p is zeroGradient, and nut uses nutLowReWallFunction. Inlet and outlet have freestream values for U, p, and nut. \n\nFor k and omega, since they're using k-Omega SST, I need to set initial and boundary conditions for these variables. The inlet should have turbulent kinetic energy (k) and specific dissipation rate (omega) based on the freestream values. The outlet can use inletOutlet for k and omega, with freestream values. The airfoil walls for k are kqRWallFunction, and omega is omegaWallFunction.\n\nNext, the system files. The controlDict must specify application simpleFoam, start/end times, time step, write intervals, etc. The fvSchemes and fvSolution need to be appropriate for steady-state RANS simulations. The fvSolution should have solvers for p, U, k, omega, and nut, using SIMPLE for pressure-velocity coupling.\n\nIn the constant directory, turbulenceProperties must select the kOmegaSST model. transportProperties should have the kinematic viscosity (nu) calculated from Re=6e6, chord length, and velocity. Let me compute nu: Re = (velocity * chord)/nu → nu = (52.08 * 1)/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s, which matches the given nut initial condition. So transportProperties will have nu [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 8.68e-06.\n\nI need to ensure all files have the correct FoamFile headers without the OpenFOAM banner. Each file's class and object must be correctly set, like volScalarField for k, omega, etc. Also, check that the boundary conditions in each 0 file match the user's JSON exactly, especially ensuring that the airfoil uses nutLowReWallFunction and the inlet/outlet have the correct types.\n\nAnother point is the turbulence model settings in constant/turbulenceProperties. The simulationType should be RAS, RASModel kOmegaSST, and turbulence on. Also, in the fvSolution, under SIMPLE, the correct relaxation factors and convergence criteria should be set based on typical steady-state cases.\n\nLastly, validate all files for consistency. Ensure that the controlDict uses the correct application (simpleFoam), all boundary types and values match the user's specifications, and that the turbulence model is correctly selected. Also, check that the initial conditions for k and omega are set appropriately based on the freestream values, which might require calculating based on turbulence intensity or other parameters, but the user didn't specify those, so perhaps use typical default values with the given nut.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Alright, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided the error message which says that the keyword 'dimensions' is undefined in the dictionary for the file \"0/p\". First, I need to understand why this is happening.\n\nLooking at the OpenFOAM case files, each field file (like 0/U, 0/p, etc.) should have a 'dimensions' entry in the FoamFile header. The error is pointing out that in the \"0/p\" file, the 'dimensions' keyword is missing. \n\nLet me check the provided \"0/p\" file content. The FoamFile block has version, format, class, and object, but no dimensions. That's the problem. Every volScalarField (like pressure) must specify its dimensions. For pressure in OpenFOAM, the dimensions are typically [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0] for kinematic pressure (since it's using incompressible solver simpleFoam). \n\nSo the fix is to add the dimensions line in the FoamFile section of the \"0/p\" file. The correct dimensions for pressure here would depend on whether it's kinematic or dynamic, but given the context of simpleFoam (which is for incompressible flows), kinematic pressure is used, hence the dimensions should be velocity squared. \n\nOther files like 0/U have the dimensions correctly specified. For example, in 0/U, the class is volVectorField, and dimensions are part of the FoamFile. The error is isolated to the \"0/p\" file missing this entry. \n\nTherefore, revising the \"0/p\" file by adding the dimensions entry should resolve the error. The user needs to edit the FoamFile block in \"0/p\" to include dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0]; right after the class and object lines.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user's getting a fatal IO error because the 'dimensions' keyword is missing in their 0/p file. The error message points to lines 9-33, so the problem is definitely in the p file's structure.\n\nFirst, I remember that in OpenFOAM, each field file like p must have a 'dimensions' entry right after the FoamFile header. The user's current p file doesn't have this, which is causing the error. Looking at the sample files provided, all of them include the dimensions line. For example, sample_file_12 has dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0], which is typical for pressure in certain turbulence models.\n\nNext, I need to make sure adding the dimensions doesn't conflict with the initial and boundary conditions specified in the paper. The initial condition for p is 0, and the boundary conditions for inlet and outlet are fixedValue 0, airfoil is zeroGradient. The sample files use similar setups, so adding the correct dimensions should be safe.\n\nThe correct dimensions for pressure in the k-omega SST model might differ based on the setup. But looking at the samples, they use [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0], which is kinematic pressure (velocity squared). That makes sense if the solver uses kinematic pressure. The user's case probably expects this, so adding that line is essential.\n\nSo the fix is to insert the dimensions line after the FoamFile block. The rest of the file, like internalField and boundaryField, should stay the same to preserve the initial and boundary conditions. The user needs to edit their 0/p file, add the dimensions, and ensure the syntax is correct without any markdown. That should resolve the error.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's look at the error message first. The error says that the keyword 'dimensions' is undefined in the dictionary for the file \"/home/hk/.../0/U\" from line 9 to 34. The error occurs when OpenFOAM tries to read the 'U' file in the 0 directory. \n\nSo, the main issue here is that the 'dimensions' entry is missing in the U file. In OpenFOAM, every field file (like U, p, k, etc.) needs to have a 'dimensions' keyword specified in the FoamFile header. This defines the units and dimensions of the field. Without this, OpenFOAM can't parse the file correctly, leading to a fatal error.\n\nLooking at the provided case files, specifically the 0/U file content, the user included the FoamFile block but didn't include the 'dimensions' line. Comparing this to other files like 0/p, which does have the 'dimensions' line, it's clear that the U file is missing this crucial entry. \n\nTo fix this, the user needs to add the correct dimensions for the velocity field. In OpenFOAM, velocity has dimensions of [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0]. So, inserting 'dimensions [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0];' right after the FoamFile block in the 0/U file should resolve the error. The rest of the U file seems okay, but the absence of dimensions is the root cause here. No other files mentioned in the error, so focus is solely on 0/U.\n",

Looking at the provided U file contents, I don't see a dimensions entry. OpenFOAM requires field files like U (velocity) to have the dimensions specified to understand the units of the field.\n\nThe error message points to the U file from line 9 to 34. The sample files from the tutorials all include the dimensions line right after the FoamFile header. For example, in sample_file_10, there's 'dimensions [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0];' which corresponds to velocity (m/s in SI units). \n\nThe user's U file is missing this line. So the fix is to add the correct dimensions. The initial and boundary conditions from the paper must stay the same. The velocity dimensions in OpenFOAM are [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0], which stands for length/time. \n\nSo the step-by-step fix would be to insert the dimensions line after the FoamFile block but before the internalField entry. That way, the file structure matches OpenFOAM's expectations without altering the prescribed initial and boundary conditions. Checking the tutorial samples confirms this placement. Also, ensuring no other parts of the file are changed maintains the required conditions.\n",

Hmm, I remember that OpenFOAM requires certain keywords depending on the turbulence model being used.\n\nLooking at the case files provided, the turbulenceProperties file specifies the RAS model as kOmegaSST. The k-Omega SST model typically uses the 'nut' field and requires the kinematic viscosity 'nu' to be defined. But wait, the transportProperties file only has 'nu' defined. However, some turbulence models might require specifying the viscosity model explicitly, like 'Newtonian' for constant viscosity.\n\nIn OpenFOAM versions that use the new framework, the transportProperties might need a 'transportModel' entry. For incompressible flows with a Newtonian fluid, you usually set viscosityModel to Newtonian and then specify 'nu'. The current transportProperties file only has 'nu' without the viscosityModel keyword. That's probably the issue. The error is because the solver expects the viscosityModel entry but it's missing.\n\nSo, the wrong file is constant/transportProperties. To fix it, we need to add the viscosityModel entry. The steps would be: open transportProperties, add 'viscosityModel Newtonian;' before the nu entry. That should resolve the missing keyword error.\n",

The underlying cause for all three is a missing keyword in their respective dictionaries, but the specific missing keywords and files are different. However, the error messages all point to the same function in the code (dictionary.C line 831), which handles missing entries. But the actual missing entries (keywords) are different each time. The first is a different keyword (viscosityModel) compared to the next two (dimensions). So, each error is about a missing keyword, but not the same keyword repeated three times. The first is unique, the next two share the same missing keyword but in different files. So, the same error (same exact message) hasn't occurred three times. Each instance is a different missing keyword in different files. Therefore, the answer is no.\n",

The current file has 'nu' defined but no 'transportModel' entry. Looking at the sample files from the tutorials, they include 'transportModel Newtonian;' followed by 'nu'. The error is because the solver expects a viscosityModel entry, which is typically specified via the transportModel. So the fix is to add 'transportModel Newtonian;' before the nu entry. Also, the user mentioned not to alter initial or boundary conditions, so adding this line shouldn't affect those since it's just specifying the type of viscosity model. The initial 'nut' is set, which is the turbulent viscosity, but the laminar viscosity 'nu' is already present. So the correction is straightforward: insert the transportModel line.\n",

The sample files from the tutorials all include the dimensions line right after the FoamFile block. So, the missing dimensions is the root cause here.\n\nThe user's initial and boundary conditions from the paper specify that nut should have a value of 8.68e-6 in the initial and inlet/outlet, and use nutLowReWallFunction on the airfoil.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's look at the error message first. The user provided an OpenFOAM runtime error that says \"keyword wallDist is undefined in dictionary /.../system/fvSchemes\". The error occurs when the code tries to access the 'wallDist' keyword in the fvSchemes file, but it's not there. \n\nNow, I need to figure out why the 'wallDist' keyword is missing. OpenFOAM's fvSchemes dictionary usually has different sections like ddtSchemes, gradSchemes, divSchemes, etc. The wallDist is related to the wall distance calculation, which is required by certain turbulence models, especially when using wall functions.\n\nLooking at the case files provided, the turbulence model is set to kOmegaSST in constant/turbulenceProperties. The k-Omega SST model might require the wall distance to be computed, which is typically handled by the 'wallDist' entry in fvSchemes. If the 'wallDist' scheme isn't specified, OpenFOAM can't find it, leading to this error.\n\nThe system/fvSchemes file provided doesn't have a wallDist section. So the solution is to add the wallDist entry to fvSchemes. The correct entry is usually:\n\nwallDist\n{\n    method meshWave;\n}\n\nAdding this section should resolve the error because it tells OpenFOAM how to compute the wall distance. The method meshWave is commonly used for this purpose. Therefore, the wrong file is system/fvSchemes, and the advice is to add the wallDist section with meshWave method there.\n",

Each error is about a missing keyword but in different files and different keywords: wallDist, dimensions, viscosityModel. The functions called are different in Error 1 (subDict) versus Errors 2 and 3 (lookupEntry). Although two errors come from the same line in the code, the actual missing keywords and the context (different dictionaries/files) are unique.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error because the keyword 'wallDist' is undefined in their fvSchemes file. The error message points to lines 11 to 40 in the fvSchemes dictionary. \n\nFirst, I need to check what the fvSchemes file contains. Looking at the provided content, I see entries for ddtSchemes, gradSchemes, divSchemes, etc., but there's no 'wallDist' section. The sample files from the tutorials (like sample_file_16 and sample_file_1) include a 'wallDist' block with the method set to 'meshWave'. That must be the missing part here.\n\nThe wallDist entry is necessary for certain turbulence models that require the distance from the wall, like the k-omega SST model mentioned in the case name. Without this, OpenFOAM can't compute the wall distance, leading to the error. \n\nTo fix this, the user needs to add the wallDist section to their fvSchemes file. The correct addition would be:\n\nwallDist\n{\n    method          meshWave;\n}\n\nThis should be placed at the end of the existing entries, probably after snGradSchemes. Checking the sample files confirms that's where it's located. The rest of the existing entries look okay and don't interfere with the initial or boundary conditions specified. The turbulence model settings in divSchemes for k and omega are using upwind, which is appropriate. Adding wallDist won't affect the initial or boundary conditions as it's related to the numerical schemes, not the field values themselves.\n\nSo the main step is inserting the wallDist block. The user should open the fvSchemes file, add the missing section, save it, and then rerun the case. That should resolve the fatal error.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided the error message which says that the keyword 'dimensions' is undefined in the dictionary for the file \"0/k\". So, the problem is in the '0/k' file.\n\nLooking at the case files, let's check the content of '0/k'. The user included it here. Let me look at the '0/k' entry. The FoamFile header seems correct with version, format, class, and object. Then, the internalField and boundaryField are set. But wait, after the FoamFile block, there's no 'dimensions' entry. \n\nIn OpenFOAM, every field file (like U, p, k, omega, etc.) must specify the 'dimensions' of the field. For example, velocity has dimensions [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0]. The error indicates that in the '0/k' file, the 'dimensions' keyword is missing. That's definitely the root cause here.\n\nComparing with other files like '0/omega', '0/p', '0/nut', and '0/U', all of them have the 'dimensions' line after the FoamFile block. The '0/k' file is missing this line. So, the solution is to add the correct dimensions for turbulent kinetic energy 'k'. \n\nWhat are the correct dimensions for 'k'? In the context of turbulence models like k-omega SST, 'k' has dimensions of [m²/s²], which translates to [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0]. So, adding 'dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0];' after the FoamFile block in the '0/k' file should fix the error.\n\nTherefore, the wrong file is '0/k', and the advice is to add the dimensions line with the correct units. That should resolve the fatal IO error.\n",

So the first thing I need to check is the structure of the k file.\n\nLooking at the provided file contents, the FoamFile header is correct with version, format, class, and object. But right after that, there's no 'dimensions' entry. OpenFOAM requires each field to specify its dimensions. The sample files from the tutorials all include the dimensions line after the FoamFile block. For example, sample_file_7 has \"dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0];\" for k. \n\nThe turbulence kinetic energy k has dimensions of velocity squared, which is [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0]. The user's file is missing this, so adding that line should fix the error. \n\nNow, checking the initial and boundary conditions from the paper. The internalField is uniform 0.378, which matches the initial conditions. The boundary conditions for inlet, outlet, and airfoil are set as fixedValue, inletOutlet, and kqRWallFunction respectively, which align with the provided JSON. The paper's BCs mention 'nut' settings but not k, so as long as the k boundary types are correct and the values are maintained, adding dimensions won't affect those conditions.\n\nThe correction is straightforward: insert the dimensions line right after the FoamFile block. The user should make sure the dimensions are correctly specified without altering the existing field values or boundary conditions. That should resolve the missing keyword error.\n",

So, the first thing I need to check is the content of the \"0/omega\" file.\n\nLooking at the provided case files, when I check \"0/omega\", the FoamFile header is there with version, format, class, and object. But after that, the internalField is set, and then the boundaryField. Wait, I don't see a 'dimensions' entry in the \"0/omega\" file. That's a problem because OpenFOAM requires each field to have dimensions specified. \n\nComparing this to other files like \"0/k\" or \"0/p\", they all have the 'dimensions' line right after the FoamFile block. For example, \"0/k\" has dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0]. The turbulence model k-omega SST would expect both k and omega to have their correct dimensions. Omega's dimensions should be [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0] because omega is in units of 1/s (per second). \n\nSo, the root cause is that the \"0/omega\" file is missing the 'dimensions' entry. The fix would be to add that line with the correct dimensions. The user should edit the \"0/omega\" file, inserting 'dimensions [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0];' right after the FoamFile block and before the internalField. That should resolve the fatal IO error.\n",

    "assistant_response": "\n\nTo resolve the \"keyword dimensions is undefined\" error in the '0/omega' file: Insert the line 'dimensions      [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0];' immediately after the FoamFile header (line 9) and before 'internalField'. This defines the correct dimensional units for omega ([1/s]) without altering initial/boundary conditions. The corrected file structure should be: FoamFile{...} dimensions[...]; internalField... boundaryField{...}. Maintain all existing numerical values and BC types from the original file.",
    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's look at the error message first. The user is getting a FATAL IO ERROR because the 'dimensions' keyword is undefined in the omega file. The error points to lines 9 to 35, which in the provided file content starts right after the FoamFile header. The OpenFOAM dictionaries require certain mandatory entries, and for a volScalarField like omega, the dimensions are crucial.\n\nLooking at the user's omega file, I notice that the 'dimensions' line is missing. Comparing it to the sample files from the tutorials, each omega file includes a dimensions entry, such as [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0], which corresponds to units of 1/seconds. The absence of this line is definitely causing the error.\n\nNext, I need to check if adding the dimensions will conflict with the initial and boundary conditions specified in the paper. The initial conditions for omega are set as a uniform value, and the boundary conditions include fixedValue at the inlet, inletOutlet at the outlet, and omegaWallFunction on the airfoil. The dimensions don't affect these values directly but are necessary for OpenFOAM to understand the field's units.\n\nThe sample files provided by the user all have the dimensions correctly set. For example, sample_file_2 and sample_file_4 both have dimensions [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0]. The user's omega file should include this line right after the FoamFile block and before the internalField entry.\n\nSo the fix is to insert the 'dimensions [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0];' line. This addition won't alter the initial or boundary condition values but will resolve the missing keyword error. The rest of the file, including the internalField and boundaryField entries, should remain unchanged to maintain the required setup from the paper.\n",
