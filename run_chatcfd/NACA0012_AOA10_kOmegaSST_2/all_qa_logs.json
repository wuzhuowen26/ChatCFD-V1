    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to convert a JSON string into a specific Markdown format. The main points are that each top-level key becomes a main heading, and the key-value pairs under it become unordered list items. Also, the hierarchy should be maintained in the list format.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the provided JSON. The JSON has a top-level key \"Case_AOA10_kOmegaSST\". Under that, there are several keys like \"case_name\", \"solver\", etc. Each of these should be list items under the main heading.\n\nSo the main heading will be \"# Case_AOA10_kOmegaSST\". Then, each sub-key and value will be a bullet point. For example, \"- **case_name**: NACA0012_AOA10_kOmegaSST\".\n\nWait, I need to make sure that each key-value pair is rendered as an unordered list item. The keys should probably be bolded, using double asterisks. The values are just plain text after the colon.\n\nLet me check the example given. The user provided a sample input and wants the corresponding Markdown. Let me reconstruct the correct structure.\n\nOriginal JSON structure:\n{\n    \"Case_AOA10_kOmegaSST\": {\n        \"key1\": \"value1\",\n        \"key2\": \"value2\",\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nIn Markdown, this should be:\n\n# Case_AOA10_kOmegaSST\n\n- **key1**: value1\n- **key2**: value2\n...\n\nYes, that makes sense. So each top-level key is a main heading (with #), and each sub-key is a list item with the key in bold followed by the value.\n\nI also need to ensure that there are no extra levels. Since the JSON provided has only two levels (the top key and its children), the Markdown should reflect that with a main heading and a list. There's no deeper hierarchy here, so no sub-lists needed.\n\nChecking the specific example given:\n\nThe \"case_specific_description\" value is a long sentence. In Markdown, it should still be a single list item. No line breaks unless necessary, but since it's a single string, it should stay as is.\n\nSo the final Markdown would look like:\n\n# Case_AOA10_kOmegaSST\n\n- **case_name**: NACA0012_AOA10_kOmegaSST\n- **solver**: simpleFoam\n- **turbulence_model**: kOmegaSST\n- **other_physical_model**: incompressible\n- **case_specific_description**: Steady-state simulation... (rest of the text)\n\nI need to make sure there's a space after the colon and that each list item starts with a hyphen and a space. Also, the main heading should have a space after the #. No trailing spaces or extra characters.\n\nYes, that should cover all the requirements. Let me put it all together correctly.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract boundary conditions from the provided paper excerpts and correct any spelling errors in the boundary type names based on the OpenFOAM boundary name list they provided. They specifically mention the boundaries for 'outlet', 'inlet', and 'airfoil' and fields 'nut', 'U', 'omega', 'p', 'k'. \n\nFirst, I need to find where the boundary conditions are described in the paper. Looking at the excerpts, on Page 4, Table 1 lists the boundary conditions used in OpenFOAM. The table mentions boundaries: Airfoil, Inlet/outlet, Front and back. The fields are U, p, nuTilda, and nut. \n\nThe user specified to correct spelling but not change the boundary types. The OpenFOAM boundary list includes 'freestreamVelocity' and 'freestreamPressure'. In the paper, the Inlet/outlet uses 'freestream velocity' and 'freestreamPressure'. 'freestream' is a valid boundary type in OpenFOAM, so 'freestream velocity' should be corrected to 'freestreamVelocity' as per the list. Similarly, 'freestreamPressure' is correct.\n\nFor the Airfoil boundary, the paper uses 'fixed-value' for U and 'nutLowReWallFunction' for nut. Checking the OpenFOAM list, 'fixedValue' is correct, but the table has 'fixed-value' with a hyphen. So correct to 'fixedValue'. 'nutLowReWallFunction' is valid. The 'noSlip' condition is mentioned for the airfoil wall, which is in the OpenFOAM list. The 'front and back' boundaries are listed as 'empty', which is valid.\n\nThe user also wants boundaries divided if they have a slash. The 'Inlet/outlet' should be split into 'inlet' and 'outlet' separately. For each field, check the boundary types. For example, 'U' at inlet uses 'freestreamVelocity', which is correct. The 'outlet' would also use 'freestream' conditions. The 'airfoil' (solid wall) uses 'noSlip' and 'nutLowReWallFunction'.\n\nNow, mapping each boundary and field correctly, ensuring spelling matches the OpenFOAM list. The final JSON should list each boundary (inlet, outlet, airfoil) with their respective fields and corrected boundary types.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the initial and boundary conditions for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil case using OpenFOAM-v2406 with the kOmegaSST model. The user provided a JSON structure that I must follow strictly without changing any boundary types. Let me go through the paper excerpts again to extract the necessary parameters.\n\nFirst, the paper mentions a Mach number of 0.15 and Reynolds number of 6e6 based on chord length. The ambient temperature is 300 K. The solver is simpleFoam, which is for steady-state, incompressible flows. So I need to convert these non-dimensional parameters into actual field values for OpenFOAM.\n\nFor the inlet and outlet boundary conditions, the JSON specifies \"freestreamVelocity\" for U and \"freestreamPressure\" for p. Since it's incompressible, pressure is kinematic (divided by density). The freestream pressure is likely zero gradient, but the JSON says \"freestreamPressure\" which I think refers to a fixed value. Wait, in simpleFoam, pressure is often set as zero gradient at inlet/outlet, but the user's JSON has \"freestreamPressure\" which might be a fixed value. However, the paper's Table 1 shows p as zero gradient at the airfoil wall and freestreamPressure at inlet/outlet. But the user's JSON structure for inlet/outlet has p as \"freestreamPressure\", which probably means a fixedValue. Wait, in OpenFOAM, for incompressible, pressure is often set with zero gradient at inlet and fixedValue at outlet, but the user's structure might be different. Need to check.\n\nThe Reynolds number is Re=6e6, chord length c=1.0 m (since it's dimensionless but the actual simulation needs physical units). The Mach number Ma=0.15. The temperature is 300 K. Let's compute the velocity.\n\nFirst, compute the speed of sound: a = sqrt(gamma*R*T). For air, gamma=1.4, R=287 J/kg·K. So a = sqrt(1.4*287*300) ≈ sqrt(1.4*86100) ≈ sqrt(120540) ≈ 347.2 m/s. Then, freestream velocity U_inf = Ma * a = 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s.\n\nReynolds number Re = (rho * U_inf * c)/mu. We need to find mu (dynamic viscosity). But Re is given as 6e6, so rearranging to find mu: mu = (rho * U_inf * c)/Re. However, for incompressible, rho is constant. Assuming ideal gas, but since it's incompressible, rho is constant. Wait, simpleFoam is for incompressible, so rho is uniform and constant. The paper doesn't specify rho, but standard air at 300 K has rho ≈ 1.225 kg/m³. Let's confirm with R = 287 J/kg·K, p = rho*R*T. If ambient pressure is 1 atm (101325 Pa), then rho = p/(R*T) = 101325/(287*300) ≈ 101325/86100 ≈ 1.176 kg/m³. So using rho=1.176 kg/m³.\n\nThen, mu = (rho * U_inf * c)/Re = (1.176 * 52.08 * 1.0)/6e6 ≈ (61.25)/6e6 ≈ 1.0208e-5 Pa·s. Kinematic viscosity nu = mu/rho ≈ 1.0208e-5 / 1.176 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, the kinematic viscosity nu is used. The turbulence model kOmegaSST requires nut (eddy viscosity), which is initialized. The initial conditions for U would be 52.08 m/s in the freestream direction (probably x-direction), p is zero (since incompressible uses kinematic pressure, where p = (static pressure - reference pressure)/rho), but initial pressure is often set to zero. For turbulence fields, k and omega need to be initialized. The user didn't mention k and omega, but since the JSON only asks for U, p, and nut, perhaps the other fields are handled elsewhere. But the user's question is about the initial and boundary conditions as per the provided JSON structure.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the airfoil (wall) are no-slip for U, zeroGradient for p, and nutLowReWallFunction for nut. For inlet and outlet, U is freestreamVelocity (fixedValue), p is freestreamPressure (maybe fixedValue 0?), and nut is freestream (turbulent viscosity in freestream, which for kOmegaSST, the freestream nut can be zero if the flow is fully turbulent, but maybe calculated from the turbulence intensity and viscosity ratio).\n\nWait, the original paper uses the S-A model and their own model. But the user wants to use kOmegaSST. However, the boundary conditions in the JSON are fixed. The user wants to know the values for U, p, and nut based on the flow parameters (Ma=0.15, Re=6e6, T=300K).\n\nSo converting Mach 0.15 to velocity as 52.08 m/s. The pressure in incompressible is kinematic, so if the reference pressure is atmospheric (101325 Pa), then p = 0 (since p = (P - P_ref)/rho). So initial and freestream pressure would be 0. For nut, in the freestream, if the flow is considered fully turbulent, nut can be calculated as nut = nu_tilda (for S-A), but for kOmegaSST, the freestream nut is typically a small value or based on turbulence intensity. However, the user's JSON specifies \"freestream\" for nut at inlet/outlet, which in OpenFOAM terms is usually a fixedValue with a calculated value. Alternatively, it might be a freestream turbulence viscosity. Since the user wants to follow the structure strictly, perhaps the nut in the freestream is set to a value derived from Re and Ma. But the paper doesn't specify turbulence intensity. However, in the absence of specific turbulence parameters, a common approach is to set a small turbulent viscosity ratio. For example, turbulent viscosity ratio (nu_t/nu) could be set to 10 or similar. But the user's case is a low-speed flow, so maybe the freestream turbulence is low. Let's assume a turbulence intensity of 0.1% and a viscosity ratio of 10. Then, nut = nu_t = (nu_t/nu) * nu = 10 * 8.68e-6 ≈ 8.68e-5 m²/s. But this is a guess. However, the paper doesn't provide specifics on turbulence parameters, so I need to make assumptions based on standard practices. Alternatively, since the original paper used S-A and the new model, but the user is using kOmegaSST, the nut boundary conditions might need to be adjusted. However, the JSON structure provided by the user specifies \"nut\" for inlet/outlet as \"freestream\", which in OpenFOAM's boundary conditions for kOmegaSST would typically use a calculated or fixedValue based on turbulence model parameters. But the user's JSON structure seems to use \"freestream\" as a keyword, which might correspond to a fixedValue with a specific value. Since the user insists on strictly following the provided JSON structure, and the original paper's boundary conditions (Table 1) for nut at inlet/outlet is \"freestream\" (which in their case, for S-A model, nuTilda is set to freestream value), perhaps for kOmegaSST, the nut at inlet/outlet is set to a value derived from the turbulence model's freestream conditions. However, without specific turbulence parameters like turbulence intensity or length scale, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nAlternatively, since the flow is at Re=6e6, which is high, and the paper uses wall-resolved LES (but no, it's RANS). For kOmegaSST, the inlet turbulence quantities can be estimated using formulas. For example, turbulence intensity I = 0.1% (0.001), then turbulent kinetic energy k = 1.5*(U*I)^2 = 1.5*(52.08*0.001)^2 ≈ 1.5*(0.05208)^2 ≈ 0.00407 m²/s². Specific dissipation rate omega can be estimated using omega = (k^0.5)/(Cmu^0.25 * L), where Cmu=0.09, and L is turbulence length scale. Assuming L = 0.07*chord_length = 0.07*1 = 0.07 m, then omega = sqrt(0.00407)/(0.09^0.25 * 0.07) ≈ 0.0638 / (0.547 * 0.07) ≈ 0.0638 / 0.0383 ≈ 1.665 rad/s. Then, nut = k/(omega) ≈ 0.00407 / 1.665 ≈ 0.00244 m²/s. But this is for k and omega. However, the user's JSON only asks for nut. Alternatively, in OpenFOAM, the freestream nut for kOmegaSST can be calculated as nut = 0.14 * nu (assuming a default viscosity ratio). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the user's case is similar to the original paper which used S-A model with nuTilda set to freestream (probably 3*nu or similar), maybe for nut in kOmegaSST, set it to a small value like 1e-5 m²/s. But this is uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the original paper's boundary conditions (Table 1), for the S-A model, nuTilda is set to fixedValue at inlet/outlet with freestream values. The nut for the new model is set to freestream. The user's JSON structure for nut at inlet/outlet is \"freestream\", which in OpenFOAM terms for the S-A model would be a fixedValue with a calculated nuTilda. But for kOmegaSST, nut is derived from k and omega. However, the user's JSON structure seems to require specific values for U, p, and nut. Since the user wants to follow the structure strictly, perhaps the nut at inlet/outlet is set to a fixedValue of 0, but that's not correct. Alternatively, in the original paper, the freestream nut might be computed based on the turbulence model. For the S-A model, the freestream nuTilda is typically set to a small value, like 0.1*nu. But without explicit information, this is tricky.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the information I have. The key parameters are:\n\n- U_inlet = 52.08 m/s (x-direction)\n- p = 0 (kinematic pressure)\n- nu = 8.68e-6 m²/s\n- Re = 6e6\n- Ma = 0.15\n\nFor nut in the freestream, assuming low turbulence, maybe set nut to a small value like 1e-5 m²/s. But I need to ensure that the turbulent viscosity ratio (nut/nu) is reasonable. For example, if nut = 1e-5, then ratio is 1e-5 / 8.68e-6 ≈ 1.15, which is plausible for a low turbulence case. Alternatively, if the turbulence intensity is very low, nut could be zero, but that's not realistic. \n\nTherefore, the initial conditions would be:\n\n- U: (52.08 0 0) m/s\n- p: 0\n- nut: 1e-5 m²/s (freestream value)\n\nFor the airfoil wall, nut uses nutLowReWallFunction, which automatically computes the near-wall turbulence.\n\nSo compiling this into the JSON structure as per the user's request, the final answer should have:\n\n- Inlet and outlet U as fixedValue (52.08 m/s in x-direction)\n- Inlet and outlet p as fixedValue 0\n- Inlet and outlet nut as fixedValue 1e-5\n- Airfoil U as noSlip (zero velocity)\n- Airfoil p as zeroGradient\n- Airfoil nut as nutLowReWallFunction\n\nBut the user's JSON structure uses keywords like \"freestreamVelocity\" and \"freestreamPressure\", which in OpenFOAM are typically implemented with fixedValue and a uniform value. So translating that:\n\n- Inlet and outlet U: fixedValue (52.08 0 0)\n- Inlet and outlet p: fixedValue 0\n- Inlet and outlet nut: fixedValue 1e-5\n\nBut the user's JSON specifies \"freestreamVelocity\" and \"freestreamPressure\", which might be OpenFOAM patches or using a function like freestream. However, in the context of the user's JSON, \"freestreamVelocity\" likely refers to a fixedValue with the calculated velocity, and similarly for pressure. The user might have specific names in mind, but since the JSON structure is given, I'll map \"freestreamVelocity\" to the actual velocity value and \"freestreamPressure\" to the pressure value.\n\nThus, the final JSON would have:\n\n- \"U\" at inlet/outlet set to the calculated velocity (52.08 m/s in x)\n- \"p\" at inlet/outlet set to 0\n- \"nut\" at inlet/outlet set to a small value like 1e-5\n\nBut wait, in the original paper's boundary conditions (Table 1), for the S-A model, the inlet/outlet for U is fixedValue with freestream velocity, p is freestreamPressure (which in the paper's case is zero gradient?), but the user's JSON says \"freestreamPressure\" for p at inlet/outlet, which in OpenFOAM for simpleFoam is usually zero gradient for inlet and fixedValue for outlet. But the user's structure has \"freestreamPressure\" for both, which might mean fixedValue 0. Since the user insists on not changing the boundary types, I'll follow that.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n    \"initialConditions\": {\n        \"U\": [52.08, 0, 0],\n        \"p\": 0,\n        \"nut\": 1e-5\n    },\n    \"boundaryConditions\": {\n        \"inlet\": {\n            \"U\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": [52.08, 0, 0]},\n            \"p\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": 0},\n            \"nut\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": 1e-5}\n        },\n        \"outlet\": {\n            \"U\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": [52.08, 0, 0]},\n            \"p\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": 0},\n            \"nut\": {\"type\": \"fixedValue\", \"value\": 1e-5}\n        },\n        \"airfoil\": {\n            \"U\": {\"type\": \"noSlip\"},\n            \"p\": {\"type\": \"zeroGradient\"},\n            \"nut\": {\"type\": \"nutLowReWallFunction\"}\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the user provided a JSON structure with \"freestreamVelocity\", \"freestreamPressure\", and \"freestream\" as values, not types. Wait, the user's example JSON has:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"boundaryConditions\": {\n        \"inlet\": {\n            \"U\": \"freestreamVelocity\",\n            \"p\": \"freestreamPressure\",\n            \"nut\": \"freestream\"\n        },\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo the user expects the values to be set as \"freestreamVelocity\", etc., but in OpenFOAM, these are implemented with specific boundary types and values. However, the user probably wants the actual numerical values based on the flow parameters. The user's instruction says: \"Convert these flow parameters to the field values.\" So the \"freestreamVelocity\" should be replaced with the actual velocity value, \"freestreamPressure\" with the actual pressure value, and \"freestream\" for nut with the actual turbulent viscosity value.\n\nTherefore, the correct JSON should replace the placeholders with numerical values:\n\n- \"U\" at inlet/outlet: 52.08 m/s in x-direction\n- \"p\" at inlet/outlet: 0 (since it's kinematic pressure)\n- \"nut\" at inlet/outlet: 1e-5 m²/s (assuming a small turbulent viscosity)\n\nThus, the final JSON is as follows.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted.

It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2.

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident. This paper used the structured mesh of 897×257\\nfor subsequent calculation, with the airfoil wall y + <1.0.\\nFigure 1: Computational domain of NACA0012 airfoil\\nFigure 2: Computational domain grid\\nFigure 3: Computational grid near NACA0012 airfoil Figure\\nPage 6:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 4: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient\\nThe boundary conditions are inlet boundary, outlet boundary, solid wall boundary, and empty\\nboundary.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack.

Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to set up an OpenFOAM case for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil using the k-Omega SST model with specific initial and boundary conditions. They provided a JSON structure that needs to be strictly followed. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the necessary files for an OpenFOAM case. The key files mentioned are in the 0/, system/, and constant/ directories. For the k-Omega SST model, the 0 directory should include k, omega, nut, p, and U files. The system directory requires controlDict, fvSchemes, fvSolution, and maybe others. The constant directory needs turbulenceProperties and transportProperties.\n\nStarting with the 0 files. The user specified initial conditions: U is [52.08, 0, 0], p is 0, and nut is 8.68e-6. The boundary conditions for inlet, outlet, and airfoil must be set accordingly. For the airfoil, U is no-slip (fixedValue [0 0 0]), p is zeroGradient, and nut uses nutLowReWallFunction. Inlet and outlet have freestream values for U, p, and nut. \n\nFor k and omega, since they're using k-Omega SST, I need to set initial and boundary conditions for these variables. The inlet should have turbulent kinetic energy (k) and specific dissipation rate (omega) based on the freestream values. The outlet can use inletOutlet for k and omega, with freestream values. The airfoil walls for k are kqRWallFunction, and omega is omegaWallFunction.\n\nNext, the system files. The controlDict must specify application simpleFoam, start/end times, time step, write intervals, etc. The fvSchemes and fvSolution need to be appropriate for steady-state RANS simulations. The fvSolution should have solvers for p, U, k, omega, and nut, using SIMPLE for pressure-velocity coupling.\n\nIn the constant directory, turbulenceProperties must select the kOmegaSST model. transportProperties should have the kinematic viscosity (nu) calculated from Re=6e6, chord length, and velocity. Let me compute nu: Re = (velocity * chord)/nu → nu = (52.08 * 1)/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s, which matches the given nut initial condition. So transportProperties will have nu [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 8.68e-06.\n\nI need to ensure all files have the correct FoamFile headers without the OpenFOAM banner. Each file's class and object must be correctly set, like volScalarField for k, omega, etc. Also, check that the boundary conditions in each 0 file match the user's JSON exactly, especially ensuring that the airfoil uses nutLowReWallFunction and the inlet/outlet have the correct types.\n\nAnother point is the turbulence model settings in constant/turbulenceProperties. The simulationType should be RAS, RASModel kOmegaSST, and turbulence on. Also, in the fvSolution, under SIMPLE, the correct relaxation factors and convergence criteria should be set based on typical steady-state cases.\n\nLastly, validate all files for consistency. Ensure that the controlDict uses the correct application (simpleFoam), all boundary types and values match the user's specifications, and that the turbulence model is correctly selected. Also, check that the initial conditions for k and omega are set appropriately based on the freestream values, which might require calculating based on turbulence intensity or other parameters, but the user didn't specify those, so perhaps use typical default values with the given nut.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Alright, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided the error message which says that the keyword 'dimensions' is undefined in the dictionary for the file \"0/p\". First, I need to understand why this is happening.\n\nLooking at the OpenFOAM case files, each field file (like 0/U, 0/p, etc.) should have a 'dimensions' entry in the FoamFile header. The error is pointing out that in the \"0/p\" file, the 'dimensions' keyword is missing. \n\nLet me check the provided \"0/p\" file content. The FoamFile block has version, format, class, and object, but no dimensions. That's the problem. Every volScalarField (like pressure) must specify its dimensions. For pressure in OpenFOAM, the dimensions are typically [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0] for kinematic pressure (since it's using incompressible solver simpleFoam). \n\nSo the fix is to add the dimensions line in the FoamFile section of the \"0/p\" file. The correct dimensions for pressure here would depend on whether it's kinematic or dynamic, but given the context of simpleFoam (which is for incompressible flows), kinematic pressure is used, hence the dimensions should be velocity squared. \n\nOther files like 0/U have the dimensions correctly specified. For example, in 0/U, the class is volVectorField, and dimensions are part of the FoamFile. The error is isolated to the \"0/p\" file missing this entry. \n\nTherefore, revising the \"0/p\" file by adding the dimensions entry should resolve the error. The user needs to edit the FoamFile block in \"0/p\" to include dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0]; right after the class and object lines.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user's getting a fatal IO error because the 'dimensions' keyword is missing in their 0/p file. The error message points to lines 9-33, so the problem is definitely in the p file's structure.\n\nFirst, I remember that in OpenFOAM, each field file like p must have a 'dimensions' entry right after the FoamFile header. The user's current p file doesn't have this, which is causing the error. Looking at the sample files provided, all of them include the dimensions line. For example, sample_file_12 has dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0], which is typical for pressure in certain turbulence models.\n\nNext, I need to make sure adding the dimensions doesn't conflict with the initial and boundary conditions specified in the paper. The initial condition for p is 0, and the boundary conditions for inlet and outlet are fixedValue 0, airfoil is zeroGradient. The sample files use similar setups, so adding the correct dimensions should be safe.\n\nThe correct dimensions for pressure in the k-omega SST model might differ based on the setup. But looking at the samples, they use [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0], which is kinematic pressure (velocity squared). That makes sense if the solver uses kinematic pressure. The user's case probably expects this, so adding that line is essential.\n\nSo the fix is to insert the dimensions line after the FoamFile block. The rest of the file, like internalField and boundaryField, should stay the same to preserve the initial and boundary conditions. The user needs to edit their 0/p file, add the dimensions, and ensure the syntax is correct without any markdown. That should resolve the error.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's look at the error message first. The error says that the keyword 'dimensions' is undefined in the dictionary for the file \"/home/hk/.../0/U\" from line 9 to 34. The error occurs when OpenFOAM tries to read the 'U' file in the 0 directory. \n\nSo, the main issue here is that the 'dimensions' entry is missing in the U file. In OpenFOAM, every field file (like U, p, k, etc.) needs to have a 'dimensions' keyword specified in the FoamFile header. This defines the units and dimensions of the field. Without this, OpenFOAM can't parse the file correctly, leading to a fatal error.\n\nLooking at the provided case files, specifically the 0/U file content, the user included the FoamFile block but didn't include the 'dimensions' line. Comparing this to other files like 0/p, which does have the 'dimensions' line, it's clear that the U file is missing this crucial entry. \n\nTo fix this, the user needs to add the correct dimensions for the velocity field. In OpenFOAM, velocity has dimensions of [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0]. So, inserting 'dimensions [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0];' right after the FoamFile block in the 0/U file should resolve the error. The rest of the U file seems okay, but the absence of dimensions is the root cause here. No other files mentioned in the error, so focus is solely on 0/U.\n",

Looking at the provided U file contents, I don't see a dimensions entry. OpenFOAM requires field files like U (velocity) to have the dimensions specified to understand the units of the field.\n\nThe error message points to the U file from line 9 to 34. The sample files from the tutorials all include the dimensions line right after the FoamFile header. For example, in sample_file_10, there's 'dimensions [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0];' which corresponds to velocity (m/s in SI units). \n\nThe user's U file is missing this line. So the fix is to add the correct dimensions. The initial and boundary conditions from the paper must stay the same. The velocity dimensions in OpenFOAM are [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0], which stands for length/time. \n\nSo the step-by-step fix would be to insert the dimensions line after the FoamFile block but before the internalField entry. That way, the file structure matches OpenFOAM's expectations without altering the prescribed initial and boundary conditions. Checking the tutorial samples confirms this placement. Also, ensuring no other parts of the file are changed maintains the required conditions.\n",

Hmm, I remember that OpenFOAM requires certain keywords depending on the turbulence model being used.\n\nLooking at the case files provided, the turbulenceProperties file specifies the RAS model as kOmegaSST. The k-Omega SST model typically uses the 'nut' field and requires the kinematic viscosity 'nu' to be defined. But wait, the transportProperties file only has 'nu' defined. However, some turbulence models might require specifying the viscosity model explicitly, like 'Newtonian' for constant viscosity.\n\nIn OpenFOAM versions that use the new framework, the transportProperties might need a 'transportModel' entry. For incompressible flows with a Newtonian fluid, you usually set viscosityModel to Newtonian and then specify 'nu'. The current transportProperties file only has 'nu' without the viscosityModel keyword. That's probably the issue. The error is because the solver expects the viscosityModel entry but it's missing.\n\nSo, the wrong file is constant/transportProperties. To fix it, we need to add the viscosityModel entry. The steps would be: open transportProperties, add 'viscosityModel Newtonian;' before the nu entry. That should resolve the missing keyword error.\n",

The underlying cause for all three is a missing keyword in their respective dictionaries, but the specific missing keywords and files are different. However, the error messages all point to the same function in the code (dictionary.C line 831), which handles missing entries. But the actual missing entries (keywords) are different each time. The first is a different keyword (viscosityModel) compared to the next two (dimensions). So, each error is about a missing keyword, but not the same keyword repeated three times. The first is unique, the next two share the same missing keyword but in different files. So, the same error (same exact message) hasn't occurred three times. Each instance is a different missing keyword in different files. Therefore, the answer is no.\n",

The current file has 'nu' defined but no 'transportModel' entry. Looking at the sample files from the tutorials, they include 'transportModel Newtonian;' followed by 'nu'. The error is because the solver expects a viscosityModel entry, which is typically specified via the transportModel. So the fix is to add 'transportModel Newtonian;' before the nu entry. Also, the user mentioned not to alter initial or boundary conditions, so adding this line shouldn't affect those since it's just specifying the type of viscosity model. The initial 'nut' is set, which is the turbulent viscosity, but the laminar viscosity 'nu' is already present. So the correction is straightforward: insert the transportModel line.\n",

The sample files from the tutorials all include the dimensions line right after the FoamFile block. So, the missing dimensions is the root cause here.\n\nThe user's initial and boundary conditions from the paper specify that nut should have a value of 8.68e-6 in the initial and inlet/outlet, and use nutLowReWallFunction on the airfoil.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's look at the error message first. The user provided an OpenFOAM runtime error that says \"keyword wallDist is undefined in dictionary /.../system/fvSchemes\". The error occurs when the code tries to access the 'wallDist' keyword in the fvSchemes file, but it's not there. \n\nNow, I need to figure out why the 'wallDist' keyword is missing. OpenFOAM's fvSchemes dictionary usually has different sections like ddtSchemes, gradSchemes, divSchemes, etc. The wallDist is related to the wall distance calculation, which is required by certain turbulence models, especially when using wall functions.\n\nLooking at the case files provided, the turbulence model is set to kOmegaSST in constant/turbulenceProperties. The k-Omega SST model might require the wall distance to be computed, which is typically handled by the 'wallDist' entry in fvSchemes. If the 'wallDist' scheme isn't specified, OpenFOAM can't find it, leading to this error.\n\nThe system/fvSchemes file provided doesn't have a wallDist section. So the solution is to add the wallDist entry to fvSchemes. The correct entry is usually:\n\nwallDist\n{\n    method meshWave;\n}\n\nAdding this section should resolve the error because it tells OpenFOAM how to compute the wall distance. The method meshWave is commonly used for this purpose. Therefore, the wrong file is system/fvSchemes, and the advice is to add the wallDist section with meshWave method there.\n",

Each error is about a missing keyword but in different files and different keywords: wallDist, dimensions, viscosityModel. The functions called are different in Error 1 (subDict) versus Errors 2 and 3 (lookupEntry). Although two errors come from the same line in the code, the actual missing keywords and the context (different dictionaries/files) are unique.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error because the keyword 'wallDist' is undefined in their fvSchemes file. The error message points to lines 11 to 40 in the fvSchemes dictionary. \n\nFirst, I need to check what the fvSchemes file contains. Looking at the provided content, I see entries for ddtSchemes, gradSchemes, divSchemes, etc., but there's no 'wallDist' section. The sample files from the tutorials (like sample_file_16 and sample_file_1) include a 'wallDist' block with the method set to 'meshWave'. That must be the missing part here.\n\nThe wallDist entry is necessary for certain turbulence models that require the distance from the wall, like the k-omega SST model mentioned in the case name. Without this, OpenFOAM can't compute the wall distance, leading to the error. \n\nTo fix this, the user needs to add the wallDist section to their fvSchemes file. The correct addition would be:\n\nwallDist\n{\n    method          meshWave;\n}\n\nThis should be placed at the end of the existing entries, probably after snGradSchemes. Checking the sample files confirms that's where it's located. The rest of the existing entries look okay and don't interfere with the initial or boundary conditions specified. The turbulence model settings in divSchemes for k and omega are using upwind, which is appropriate. Adding wallDist won't affect the initial or boundary conditions as it's related to the numerical schemes, not the field values themselves.\n\nSo the main step is inserting the wallDist block. The user should open the fvSchemes file, add the missing section, save it, and then rerun the case. That should resolve the fatal error.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided the error message which says that the keyword 'dimensions' is undefined in the dictionary for the file \"0/k\". So, the problem is in the '0/k' file.\n\nLooking at the case files, let's check the content of '0/k'. The user included it here. Let me look at the '0/k' entry. The FoamFile header seems correct with version, format, class, and object. Then, the internalField and boundaryField are set. But wait, after the FoamFile block, there's no 'dimensions' entry. \n\nIn OpenFOAM, every field file (like U, p, k, omega, etc.) must specify the 'dimensions' of the field. For example, velocity has dimensions [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0]. The error indicates that in the '0/k' file, the 'dimensions' keyword is missing. That's definitely the root cause here.\n\nComparing with other files like '0/omega', '0/p', '0/nut', and '0/U', all of them have the 'dimensions' line after the FoamFile block. The '0/k' file is missing this line. So, the solution is to add the correct dimensions for turbulent kinetic energy 'k'. \n\nWhat are the correct dimensions for 'k'? In the context of turbulence models like k-omega SST, 'k' has dimensions of [m²/s²], which translates to [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0]. So, adding 'dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0];' after the FoamFile block in the '0/k' file should fix the error.\n\nTherefore, the wrong file is '0/k', and the advice is to add the dimensions line with the correct units. That should resolve the fatal IO error.\n",

So the first thing I need to check is the structure of the k file.\n\nLooking at the provided file contents, the FoamFile header is correct with version, format, class, and object. But right after that, there's no 'dimensions' entry. OpenFOAM requires each field to specify its dimensions. The sample files from the tutorials all include the dimensions line after the FoamFile block. For example, sample_file_7 has \"dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0];\" for k. \n\nThe turbulence kinetic energy k has dimensions of velocity squared, which is [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0]. The user's file is missing this, so adding that line should fix the error. \n\nNow, checking the initial and boundary conditions from the paper. The internalField is uniform 0.378, which matches the initial conditions. The boundary conditions for inlet, outlet, and airfoil are set as fixedValue, inletOutlet, and kqRWallFunction respectively, which align with the provided JSON. The paper's BCs mention 'nut' settings but not k, so as long as the k boundary types are correct and the values are maintained, adding dimensions won't affect those conditions.\n\nThe correction is straightforward: insert the dimensions line right after the FoamFile block. The user should make sure the dimensions are correctly specified without altering the existing field values or boundary conditions. That should resolve the missing keyword error.\n",

So, the first thing I need to check is the content of the \"0/omega\" file.\n\nLooking at the provided case files, when I check \"0/omega\", the FoamFile header is there with version, format, class, and object. But after that, the internalField is set, and then the boundaryField. Wait, I don't see a 'dimensions' entry in the \"0/omega\" file. That's a problem because OpenFOAM requires each field to have dimensions specified. \n\nComparing this to other files like \"0/k\" or \"0/p\", they all have the 'dimensions' line right after the FoamFile block. For example, \"0/k\" has dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0]. The turbulence model k-omega SST would expect both k and omega to have their correct dimensions. Omega's dimensions should be [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0] because omega is in units of 1/s (per second). \n\nSo, the root cause is that the \"0/omega\" file is missing the 'dimensions' entry. The fix would be to add that line with the correct dimensions. The user should edit the \"0/omega\" file, inserting 'dimensions [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0];' right after the FoamFile block and before the internalField. That should resolve the fatal IO error.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's look at the error message first. The user is getting a FATAL IO ERROR because the 'dimensions' keyword is undefined in the omega file. The error points to lines 9 to 35, which in the provided file content starts right after the FoamFile header. The OpenFOAM dictionaries require certain mandatory entries, and for a volScalarField like omega, the dimensions are crucial.\n\nLooking at the user's omega file, I notice that the 'dimensions' line is missing. Comparing it to the sample files from the tutorials, each omega file includes a dimensions entry, such as [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0], which corresponds to units of 1/seconds. The absence of this line is definitely causing the error.\n\nNext, I need to check if adding the dimensions will conflict with the initial and boundary conditions specified in the paper. The initial conditions for omega are set as a uniform value, and the boundary conditions include fixedValue at the inlet, inletOutlet at the outlet, and omegaWallFunction on the airfoil. The dimensions don't affect these values directly but are necessary for OpenFOAM to understand the field's units.\n\nThe sample files provided by the user all have the dimensions correctly set. For example, sample_file_2 and sample_file_4 both have dimensions [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0]. The user's omega file should include this line right after the FoamFile block and before the internalField entry.\n\nSo the fix is to insert the 'dimensions [0 0 -1 0 0 0 0];' line. This addition won't alter the initial or boundary condition values but will resolve the missing keyword error. The rest of the file, including the internalField and boundaryField entries, should remain unchanged to maintain the required setup from the paper.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14]. The specific\\nturbulence model equations are illustrated below.\\nThe fluctuation continuity equation is:\\nThe group average fluctuation velocity equation is:\\n( ) ( )\\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ 1 Turb Turb\\nj j i i j ij ij ij ij ij\\n∂ ∂ + + ∂ + − −\\n∂ ∂ ∂\\nσ σ σ σ u u u uu\\nWherein ˆ\\nu represents the group average fluctuation velocity and ˆ\\nσ the laminar stress\\ncorresponding to the fluctuation velocity after the group average, similar to the calculation\\nσ ˆ Turb\\nσ .

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model.

Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to extract boundary conditions from the provided research paper excerpts and correct any spelling mistakes in the boundary type names based on the OpenFOAM boundary name list they provided. They specifically mentioned the boundaries: outlet, inlet, and airfoil. The fields to consider are nut, U, omega, p, and k. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the paper excerpts to find where the boundary conditions are described. On page 6, Table 1 lists the boundary conditions used in OpenFOAM. The table mentions the boundaries as Airfoil, Inlet/outlet, and Front and back. But the user wants outlet, inlet, and airfoil. The Front and back might be part of the inlet/outlet or other boundaries, but the user specified only those three.\n\nLooking at Table 1 in the paper, under the Airfoil boundary, the U field is set to fixed-value, which might be a typo. The OpenFOAM list has 'fixedValue' as a valid name. So, 'fixed-value' should be corrected to 'fixedValue'. For nut (which is nuTilda in the table), the Airfoil uses fixed-value, which again should be 'fixedValue'. However, the OpenFOAM list has 'nutLowReWallFunction' and others, but in the table, it's 'nutLowReWallFunction' for the Airfoil. Wait, the table lists 'nut' as 'nutLowReWallFunction' under Airfoil. Wait, no, in the table, the Airfoil's nut is set to 'nutLowReWallFunction', which is a valid OpenFOAM boundary type. But the user provided a list that includes 'nutLowReWallFunction', so that's correct. Wait, let me check the OpenFOAM boundary name list again. The list includes 'nutLowReWallFunction', so that's valid. \n\nFor the Inlet/outlet boundary, the U is set to 'freestream velocity', which should be 'freestreamVelocity' as per the OpenFOAM list. Similarly, p is 'freestreamPressure', which is valid. The 'nuTilda' is set to 'freestream', which might be 'freestream' as a valid type. The 'nut' is set to 'freestream', which matches 'freestream' in the OpenFOAM list. \n\nThe Front and back boundaries are set to 'empty', which is a valid type. But the user only wants outlet, inlet, and airfoil. The paper's Table 1 has Inlet/outlet combined, but the user wants them separated. The user mentioned that if there's a slash, split them into distinct boundaries. So Inlet and outlet should be separate. However, in the paper, Inlet/outlet is a single boundary, but perhaps in reality, the computational domain has separate inlet and outlet boundaries. But according to the paper's Figure 1, the computational domain might have an inlet and an outlet. But the table lists Inlet/outlet as a single entry with 'empty' for front and back. Wait, the table's headers are Airfoil, Inlet/outlet, Front and back. So Inlet/outlet is a single boundary, but the user wants them split. So I need to separate inlet and outlet as distinct boundaries. However, the paper's setup might have combined them, but the user instruction says to split any with a slash. So 'Inlet/outlet' becomes 'inlet' and 'outlet' boundaries. But how to determine which fields apply to inlet and which to outlet? The table lists for Inlet/outlet, the fields are set to 'freestream velocity', 'freestreamPressure', 'freestream', and 'freestream' for U, p, nuTilda, and nut respectively. But in OpenFOAM, inlet and outlet might have different boundary conditions. For example, inlet could be 'fixedValue' for U and outlet could be 'zeroGradient' for p. However, the paper's setup uses 'freestreamPressure' for p in the Inlet/outlet, which is a valid OpenFOAM type. But since the user wants to split Inlet/outlet into inlet and outlet, I need to assign the correct BCs to each. \n\nWait, the paper's Table 1 says Inlet/outlet uses 'freestreamPressure' for p, which is a boundary condition that applies to both inlet and outlet? That might not be standard. Typically, inlet would have a fixedValue for velocity and outlet a zeroGradient for pressure. But according to the OpenFOAM list provided, 'freestreamPressure' is a valid type. However, the user wants to split Inlet/outlet into inlet and outlet. The problem is that the paper's setup might have a single boundary for both, but the user wants them as separate. So perhaps the Inlet/outlet in the paper is a combined boundary type, but the correct way is to have separate inlet and outlet boundaries. However, the user's instruction says to split any boundaries with a slash into distinct ones and list them separately. So in the table, Inlet/outlet is a single boundary name with a slash, so we need to split into 'inlet' and 'outlet' boundaries. \n\nBut how to determine which BC applies to which? The paper's setup might have used a mixed inlet/outlet condition, but according to the OpenFOAM list, 'inletOutlet' is a valid type. However, the user wants to split them. Since the user's instruction is to split them, perhaps the Inlet/outlet in the paper is actually two separate boundaries: inlet and outlet. So for each field, we need to assign the correct BC to inlet and outlet. But the table lists the same BC for Inlet/outlet for all fields. That might not be accurate. For example, for velocity U at inlet, it's typically 'fixedValue' (like freestreamVelocity), and at outlet, it might be 'zeroGradient' or 'inletOutlet'. But the paper's setup uses 'freestreamVelocity' for U in Inlet/outlet. Wait, in the table, under Inlet/outlet, U is set to 'freestream velocity', which should be 'freestreamVelocity' as per the OpenFOAM list. Similarly, p is 'freestreamPressure', nuTilda is 'freestream', and nut is 'freestream'. \n\nBut if we split Inlet/outlet into inlet and outlet, how to assign these BCs? The paper might have a single boundary that acts as both inlet and outlet, but that's not standard. Alternatively, the setup could have a far-field boundary that uses 'freestream' conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the Inlet/outlet is a single boundary that uses 'freestream' type, which in OpenFOAM is a valid boundary condition for far-field. However, the user's instruction is to split into inlet and outlet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the paper's Inlet/outlet is a typo and they meant to have separate inlet and outlet boundaries. But according to the user's instruction, we must only correct spelling and not change boundary types except for spelling. So if the original boundary is 'Inlet/outlet', we split into 'inlet' and 'outlet' and assign the same BCs? But that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the paper's setup has a single boundary that's both inlet and outlet, but that's not typical. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'Inlet/outlet' is a typo for 'inletOutlet' which is a valid OpenFOAM boundary type. But the user's instruction says to split any with a slash into separate boundaries. So 'Inlet/outlet' becomes 'inlet' and 'outlet' boundaries. \n\nBut how to handle the BCs for each? The paper's table lists the same BC for all fields under Inlet/outlet. So for example, U is 'freestreamVelocity' for both inlet and outlet. But in reality, inlet would have a fixedValue for U (like freestreamVelocity) and outlet might have zeroGradient for U. But the paper's setup might be using a freestream condition for both. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check the OpenFOAM boundary types again. The 'freestreamVelocity' is a valid type, as per the list provided. The 'freestreamPressure' is also valid. So perhaps the Inlet/outlet boundary in the paper is using 'freestream' conditions, which apply to both inlet and outlet. But according to the user's instruction, we need to split Inlet/outlet into inlet and outlet. However, the BCs for both would be the same as per the table. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the paper's setup has a single boundary that's treated as a freestream, which in OpenFOAM is handled by 'freestream' boundary conditions. But the user wants separate inlet and outlet boundaries. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the boundaries to consider are outlet, inlet, and airfoil (the airfoil is the solid wall). The fields are nut, U, omega, p, and k. \n\nLooking at the paper's Table 1:\n\n- Airfoil boundary:\n  - U: fixed-value (should be fixedValue)\n  - p: zero gradient (should be zeroGradient)\n  - nuTilda: fixed-value (fixedValue)\n  - nut: nutLowReWallFunction (valid as per OpenFOAM list)\n\n- Inlet/outlet boundary:\n  - U: freestream velocity (freestreamVelocity)\n  - p: freestreamPressure\n  - nuTilda: freestream\n  - nut: freestream\n\n- Front and back: empty (valid)\n\nBut the user wants to split Inlet/outlet into inlet and outlet. So for each of these new boundaries (inlet and outlet), what BCs apply? The paper's table applies the same BC to both, which may not be correct. However, the user's instruction is to split them and list separately. So perhaps the inlet and outlet both use the same BCs as per the paper's Inlet/outlet. Alternatively, maybe the inlet uses 'freestreamVelocity' for U and 'freestreamPressure' for p, while the outlet uses 'inletOutlet' or other types. But the paper's setup uses 'freestream' conditions, which might be appropriate for a far-field boundary, which could be treated as both inlet and outlet depending on the flow direction.\n\nHowever, given the user's instruction to split Inlet/outlet into inlet and outlet, and assign the BCs accordingly, I'll proceed by creating separate entries for inlet and outlet, each with the same BCs as listed in the paper's Inlet/outlet. \n\nWait, but in OpenFOAM, the 'freestream' boundary condition is typically used for far-field conditions where the flow can be incoming or outgoing. So perhaps the Inlet/outlet in the paper is a single boundary of type 'freestream', which is valid. But the user wants to split into inlet and outlet. However, the user's instruction says to split any boundaries with a slash into distinct ones. So 'Inlet/outlet' becomes 'inlet' and 'outlet', each with their own BCs. \n\nBut the paper's Table 1 doesn't differentiate between inlet and outlet, so it's unclear. Given the user's instruction, I must split them. Therefore, I'll create separate inlet and outlet boundaries, each with the BCs from the paper's Inlet/outlet entry. But this might not be technically correct, as in reality, inlet and outlet would have different BCs. However, the user's instruction is to correct spelling only and not change the boundary type except for spelling. Since the paper's Inlet/outlet uses 'freestreamVelocity' for U, which is valid, and 'freestreamPressure' for p, which is also valid, perhaps both inlet and outlet use these BCs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the inlet uses 'fixedValue' for U with a specific velocity, and the outlet uses 'zeroGradient' for U and 'fixedValue' for pressure. But according to the paper, they used 'freestream' conditions, which might imply that the boundaries are treated as far-field where the flow can enter or exit. \n\nBut given the user's instruction to split the Inlet/outlet into inlet and outlet, and the fields in the paper's table, I'll proceed to assign the same BCs to both inlet and outlet. \n\nSo, for the inlet boundary:\n- U: freestreamVelocity (corrected from 'freestream velocity')\n- p: freestreamPressure\n- nuTilda: freestream\n- nut: freestream\n\nFor the outlet boundary:\n- U: freestreamVelocity\n- p: freestreamPressure\n- nuTilda: freestream\n- nut: freestream\n\nBut this might not be accurate, as typically outlet would have different BCs. However, the user's instruction is to follow the paper's setup and only correct spelling. The paper's setup uses 'freestream' conditions for Inlet/outlet, so splitting into inlet and outlet with the same BCs is the way to go.\n\nNow, for the airfoil (solid wall), the BCs are:\n- U: fixedValue (corrected from 'fixed-value')\n- p: zeroGradient (corrected from 'zero gradient')\n- nuTilda: fixedValue\n- nut: nutLowReWallFunction\n\nThe fields omega and k are not mentioned in the paper's Table 1, but the user wants to include them. However, since the paper doesn't specify omega and k, perhaps they weren't used in the simulation. The turbulence models used are S-A and a new model, which are one-equation models. The S-A model uses nuTilda (as seen in the table), and the new model might not require k or omega. Therefore, omega and k might not be part of the BCs in this case. But the user included them in the fields to consider. Since the paper doesn't mention them, maybe they can be omitted or set to default. However, the user's instruction says to consider those fields. If the fields aren't present in the paper, perhaps they should be excluded. But the user wants to include all fields mentioned, even if the paper doesn't specify them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the omega and k are not used in the S-A model, so their BCs aren't specified. In OpenFOAM, when using the S-A model, you don't have k and omega fields. So in this case, the fields would be U, p, and nuTilda (or nut). The paper's table includes nut (as nuTilda and nut). So the fields to consider are U, p, nuTilda, and nut. The user's fields include omega and k, but since they aren't mentioned in the paper, perhaps they are not applicable. Therefore, in the JSON response, we can omit omega and k for the boundaries where they aren't specified. However, the user's instruction says to consider those fields, so maybe we need to include them with appropriate BCs if possible. \n\nBut the paper's setup uses the S-A model, which doesn't use k or omega. Therefore, those fields are not part of the simulation, and their BCs aren't set. Therefore, in the JSON response, we can omit omega and k for all boundaries. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects that even if the paper doesn't mention them, they should be included.

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object.

Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to simulate the NACA0012 airfoil case using OpenFOAM-v2406 with specific boundary conditions and initial values. The parameters given are Mach 0.15, Reynolds number 6e6, angle of attack 10°, and using the kOmegaSST model. The boundary conditions structure is provided in JSON format, and they must adhere strictly to the types listed.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the necessary parameters from the research paper. The paper mentions a Mach number of 0.15, Reynolds number based on chord length (Re=6×10^6), ambient temperature of 300 K, and angle of attack 10°. The turbulence models used in the paper are Spalart-Allmaras and a new model, but the user is asking for kOmegaSST, so I'll focus on converting the given flow parameters into OpenFOAM field values.\n\nStarting with the Mach number (Ma=0.15) and Reynolds number (Re=6e6). The chord length (c) is 1.0 m as per the computational setup. The fluid is air, so I'll use standard air properties at 300 K: kinematic viscosity (nu) can be calculated using Re = (U * c)/nu. Rearranging, nu = (U * c)/Re. But I need to find U first.\n\nThe Mach number relates to the speed of sound (a) via Ma = U/a. The speed of sound in air at 300 K is approximately sqrt(gamma * R * T). Gamma for air is 1.4, R is 287 J/kg·K. So a = sqrt(1.4 * 287 * 300) ≈ 347.2 m/s. Therefore, U = Ma * a = 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s.\n\nNow, using Re = (U * c)/nu, solve for nu: nu = (52.08 * 1.0)/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s. However, the kinematic viscosity of air at 300 K is approximately 1.568e-5 m²/s, which doesn't match. This discrepancy suggests that the Reynolds number in the paper might be based on a different reference length or velocity. Wait, the paper states the Reynolds number is based on chord length and inflow conditions. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the user provided Re=6e6, chord length c=1.0 m, so U = Re * nu / c. But if nu is for air at 300 K (1.568e-5), then U = 6e6 * 1.568e-5 / 1 = 94.08 m/s. But that would make Mach number U/a = 94.08 / 347.2 ≈ 0.27, which contradicts the given Ma=0.15. Hmm, this inconsistency needs resolution.\n\nWait, the paper mentions ambient temperature of 300 K. So maybe the viscosity is calculated at 300 K. Let me confirm. The dynamic viscosity (mu) for air at 300 K is about 1.846e-5 kg/(m·s). Then, density rho = pressure/(R*T). Assuming pressure is 1 atm (101325 Pa), rho = 101325 / (287 * 300) ≈ 1.176 kg/m³. So kinematic viscosity nu = mu/rho ≈ 1.846e-5 / 1.176 ≈ 1.568e-5 m²/s. Then, using Re = U*c/nu => U = Re*nu/c = 6e6 * 1.568e-5 / 1 = 94.08 m/s. But Mach 0.15 would require U = 0.15*a = 0.15*347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s. There's a conflict here between Re and Ma.\n\nThis suggests that the paper might have adjusted the pressure or temperature to reconcile Re and Ma. Alternatively, perhaps the chord length isn't 1m, but the paper uses a non-dimensional approach. Wait, the paper states \"the chord length (characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0\", so it's normalized. To resolve this, they might have scaled the velocity or viscosity. Let's proceed with the given Ma=0.15 and Re=6e6.\n\nTo reconcile Ma=0.15 and Re=6e6, we can adjust the reference length or the fluid properties. However, since the user wants to set up the case in OpenFOAM, we need to define the fields correctly. Let's assume standard air properties at 300 K (nu=1.568e-5 m²/s, a=347.2 m/s). Then, U=Ma*a=52.08 m/s. Re=U*c/nu => Re=52.08*1.0/1.568e-5≈3.32e6. But the paper has Re=6e6. Therefore, there's a mismatch. The paper must have different fluid properties or reference values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the paper uses a different reference velocity. For instance, if the chord length is 1m, and they want Re=6e6 with U=52.08 m/s, then nu=U*c/Re=52.08/6e6≈8.68e-6 m²/s. To achieve this nu, the dynamic viscosity would be nu*rho. If we keep rho at 1.176 kg/m³, then mu=nu*rho=8.68e-6*1.176≈1.02e-5 kg/(m·s), which is lower than the standard mu at 300K. This implies that the fluid might be at a higher temperature or lower pressure. But the paper states ambient temperature is 300 K, so this seems conflicting.\n\nGiven this inconsistency, perhaps the paper used a different approach. For the user's simulation, they need to set U, nu, etc., to match both Re and Ma. Let's proceed by calculating the necessary values to satisfy both.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. Ma = U / a\n2. Re = (U * c) / nu\n\nAnd we know a = sqrt(gamma * R * T), with T=300 K.\n\nFrom equation 1: U = Ma * a = 0.15 * sqrt(1.4 * 287 * 300) ≈ 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s.\n\nFrom equation 2: nu = (U * c) / Re = (52.08 * 1.0) / 6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s.\n\nNow, nu = mu / rho. Assuming the fluid is air, we can calculate mu and rho to satisfy this nu. Let's use the ideal gas law: p = rho * R * T. Let's assume pressure p is 101325 Pa (1 atm). Then, rho = p / (R * T) = 101325 / (287 * 300) ≈ 1.176 kg/m³.\n\nThen, mu = nu * rho = 8.68e-6 * 1.176 ≈ 1.022e-5 kg/(m·s). However, the dynamic viscosity of air at 300 K is approximately 1.846e-5 kg/(m·s). This discrepancy suggests that to achieve the desired Re and Ma, the simulation must use a fluid with lower viscosity or higher density. Alternatively, adjust the pressure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the paper scaled the problem. For OpenFOAM, the user can set the transport properties accordingly. So, in the simulation, nu is set to 8.68e-6 m²/s to match Re=6e6 and Ma=0.15. This would require modifying the transport properties in OpenFOAM, perhaps by changing the nu value in transportProperties.\n\nBut the user's question is about initial and boundary conditions, not the transport properties. So, assuming that the user has set the correct nu in the transport model, the boundary conditions for velocity, pressure, nut, and nuTilda need to be set.\n\nThe angle of attack is 10°, so the velocity components must be adjusted. The freestream velocity U is 52.08 m/s at 10°, so the components are Ux = U * cos(10°) and Uy = U * sin(10°). Calculating these: cos(10°) ≈ 0.9848, sin(10°) ≈ 0.1736. Thus, Ux ≈ 52.08 * 0.9848 ≈ 51.3 m/s, Uy ≈ 52.08 * 0.1736 ≈ 9.04 m/s.\n\nFor the pressure, the freestream pressure is 101325 Pa (1 atm). In OpenFOAM, the pressure is often treated as kinematic pressure (p/rho), but since the solver is simpleFoam (incompressible), the pressure is kinematic. Wait, no—simpleFoam is for incompressible, turbulent flow, and uses kinematic pressure (p/rho). But the user's setup might use absolute pressure. Need to clarify.\n\nIn OpenFOAM's incompressible solvers like simpleFoam, the pressure field is kinematic (p/rho), so the actual pressure is p*rho. However, the boundary conditions for pressure in the JSON are given as freestreamPressure, which in OpenFOAM's freestream boundary condition would be the value of the freestream pressure. Since the paper uses ambient conditions, the freestream pressure should be 0 (if kinematic) or 101325/rho (if absolute). But this needs to be consistent with the solver setup.\n\nAssuming the solver uses kinematic pressure (p = P/rho, where P is static pressure), then the freestreamPressure would be P/rho. Given P=101325 Pa, rho=1.176 kg/m³, p=101325 / 1.176 ≈ 86164 m²/s². However, in incompressible flow with simpleFoam, the pressure is often referenced to a reference pressure, so the initial value might be 0, and the freestreamPressure set to 0. But this depends on the case setup. Alternatively, if the solver uses absolute pressure in Pa, then the freestreamPressure is 101325 Pa.\n\nThe user's JSON specifies \"freestreamPressure\" for inlet and outlet. In OpenFOAM, the freestream boundary condition for pressure typically uses a fixed value, so the value should be the freestream pressure. Assuming absolute pressure, that's 101325 Pa. But since the user is using OpenFOAM's simpleFoam, which is incompressible, the pressure is kinematic. Therefore, the value would be 101325 / rho. With rho=1.176, that's ≈ 86164 m²/s². But the user's setup might have a different rho. Wait, the transportProperties in OpenFOAM for incompressible flow would have nu, and rho is typically 1 (but can be specified). This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is using dimensional values, and the transportProperties file has nu set to 8.68e-6 m²/s (as calculated earlier to match Re and Ma). In that case, rho is 1 (default for simpleFoam), but then the actual velocity would be adjusted. However, this is getting too deep into the setup details. The user is asking for boundary condition values, not the transportProperties.\n\nAssuming that the user has set the transportProperties correctly (nu=8.68e-6 m²/s, rho=1 kg/m³), then the kinematic pressure would be P/rho = 101325 / 1 = 101325 m²/s². But in simpleFoam, the pressure is often treated as kinematic, so the boundary condition for pressure would be 101325.\n\nBut I think the key here is to provide the velocity components adjusted for the angle of attack and the freestream values based on the given Ma and Re. The nut and nuTilda fields depend on the turbulence model. For kOmegaSST, the nut is computed from k and omega, but the boundary conditions for nut are usually nutLowReWallFunction on the airfoil and freestream elsewhere. The nuTilda is specific to the Spalart-Allmaras model, so if using kOmegaSST, nuTilda might not be used, but the JSON provided includes it, so perhaps the user is using a modified setup or including it for compatibility.\n\nIn the provided JSON, the airfoil has nuTilda as fixedValue, but for kOmegaSST, nuTilda isn't used. However, the user insists on following the JSON structure strictly, so we'll include it. The values for nuTilda and nut in the freestream need to be set. For the S-A model, nuTilda is the modified viscosity, but for kOmegaSST, perhaps it's ignored. However, the user's setup might require it, so we'll set it to the same as the freestream value, which in the paper's case for S-A model was nuTilda=3*nu (approximate common practice), but without specific info, we'll set it to 0 or a small value.\n\nWait, in the paper's boundary conditions (Table 1), for inlet/outlet, nuTilda is freestream, and for airfoil, it's fixedValue. The values in the paper aren't explicitly given, but in OpenFOAM's S-A model, the freestream nuTilda is usually set to 3*nu to 5*nu. For example, nuTilda = 3*nu. With nu=8.68e-6, nuTilda=2.6e-5. However, since the user is using kOmegaSST, nuTilda might not be relevant, but the JSON requires it. Therefore, we'll set nuTilda to a small value, perhaps 0. However, in the JSON provided, the airfoil's nuTilda is fixedValue, so maybe the user's case includes S-A and kOmegaSST together, which isn't standard. But the user insists on following the JSON structure, so we'll proceed.\n\nFor the initial conditions, U is the freestream velocity (51.3, 9.04, 0) m/s, p is freestreamPressure (101325 Pa), nut is the turbulent viscosity, which in the freestream can be calculated as nut = nuTilda (for S-A), but for kOmegaSST, the freestream nut is typically a small value, perhaps 1e-5. However, without specific info, we'll set it based on the turbulence model. For kOmegaSST, the freestream turbulence variables (k and omega) are needed, but the user's JSON doesn't include them, only nut and nuTilda. This complicates things, but since the user provided a specific JSON structure, perhaps they have a way to handle it, or maybe the case is set up with nut calculated from k and omega.\n\nBut the user's question is about initial and boundary conditions, so we need to define the values for U, p, nut, and nuTilda. For the initial fields:\n\n- U: (51.3, 9.04, 0) m/s\n- p: 101325 Pa (if absolute) or 86164 m²/s² (if kinematic)\n- nut: turbulent viscosity. For kOmegaSST, in the freestream, nut can be calculated using the turbulence intensity and mixing length. Let's assume turbulence intensity (I) of 1% and a mixing length (l) of 0.07*L, where L is the characteristic length (chord). Then, l=0.07*1=0.07 m. Then, k = (3/2)*(U*I)^2 = (3/2)*(52.08*0.01)^2 ≈ (3/2)*(0.5208)^2 ≈ 0.406 m²/s². Omega = k^(0.5)/(Cμ^0.25*l), where Cμ=0.09. So omega = sqrt(0.406)/(0.09^0.25 *0.07) ≈ 0.637 / (0.547 *0.07) ≈ 16.6 1/s. Then, nut = k/omega = 0.406/16.6 ≈ 0.0245 m²/s. But this is a rough estimate. However, the user's JSON specifies nut as freestream, which in OpenFOAM would require a value. Alternatively, for simplicity, set nut to a small value like 1e-5 m²/s.\n\nnuTilda is specific to the S-A model, but since the user's setup includes it, perhaps set to 0 or a small value. However, in the paper's setup for S-A, nuTilda at freestream is set to 3*nu. So with nu=8.68e-6, nuTilda=2.6e-5 m²/s.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nInitial conditions:\n\n- U: (51.3, 9.04, 0) m/s\n- p: 101325 Pa (assuming absolute pressure)\n- nut: 0.0245 m²/s (from turbulence model calculation)\n- nuTilda: 2.6e-5 m²/s (for S-A model compatibility)\n\nBut the user's case uses kOmegaSST, so nuTilda isn't used. However, the JSON requires it, so we set it as per the paper's S-A setup.\n\nBoundary conditions as per JSON:\n\n- Airfoil:\n  - U: fixedValue (no-slip, so (0 0 0))\n  - p: zeroGradient\n  - nut: nutLowReWallFunction (automatically handled by OpenFOAM)\n  - nuTilda: fixedValue (0, but per S-A, maybe 0)\n\nWait, in the paper's Table 1, the airfoil's nuTilda is fixedValue. For S-A model, the wall boundary condition for nuTilda is typically fixedValue 0. So set nuTilda on airfoil to 0.\n\nInlet and Outlet:\n\n- U: freestreamVelocity with value (51.3, 9.04, 0)\n- p: freestreamPressure with value 101325\n- nut: freestream with value 0.0245 (from earlier calculation)\n- nuTilda: freestream with value 2.6e-5\n\nBut the user's JSON specifies the boundary types, not the values. The user asks to convert flow parameters to field values. The JSON structure must have the values filled in.\n\nNow, compiling all this into the required JSON format. The final answer should include initial and boundary conditions with values derived from Ma=0.15, Re=6e6, angle of attack 10°, T=300 K.\n\nFinal values:\n\n- U_initial: (51.3, 9.04, 0) m/s\n- p_initial: 101325 Pa\n- nut_initial: 0.0245 m²/s\n- nuTilda_initial: 2.6e-5 m²/s\n\nBoundary conditions:\n\n- Airfoil:\n  - U: fixedValue (0 0 0)\n  - p: zeroGradient\n  - nut: nutLowReWallFunction (automatically computed, but initial can be 0)\n  - nuTilda: fixedValue 0\n- Inlet/outlet:\n  - U: freestreamVelocity (51.3, 9.04, 0)\n  - p: freestreamPressure 101325\n  - nut: freestream 0.0245\n  - nuTilda: freestream 2.6e-5\n\nBut need to confirm the exact OpenFOAM syntax for boundary conditions. For example, fixedValue for U on the airfoil is (0 0 0). The freestreamVelocity would be a vector. The freestreamPressure is a scalar. The nut and nuTilda are scalars.\n\nHowever, in OpenFOAM, the freestream boundary condition requires a freestream value and a value for the field. For example, for U, the inlet might use type freestreamVelocity with a freestreamValue (vector). Similarly for p, freestreamPressure with a scalar value.\n\nBut the user's JSON structure specifies the types, and the values need to be filled in. The user wants the JSON to include the initial and boundary conditions with these values.\n\nPutting it all together, the final JSON would look like this:\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2.

The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14]. The specific\\nturbulence model equations are illustrated below.\\nThe fluctuation continuity equation is:\\nThe group average fluctuation velocity equation is:\\n( ) ( )\\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ 1 Turb Turb\\nj j i i j ij ij ij ij ij\\n∂ ∂ + + ∂ + − −\\n∂ ∂ ∂\\nσ σ σ σ u u u uu\\nWherein ˆ\\nu represents the group average fluctuation velocity and ˆ\\nσ the laminar stress\\ncorresponding to the fluctuation velocity after the group average, similar to the calculation\\nσ ˆ Turb\\nσ .

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident. This paper used the structured mesh of 897×257\\nfor subsequent calculation, with the airfoil wall y + <1.0.\\nFigure 1: Computational domain of NACA0012 airfoil\\nFigure 2: Computational domain grid\\nFigure 3: Computational grid near NACA0012 airfoil Figure\\nPage 6:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 4: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient\\nThe boundary conditions are inlet boundary, outlet boundary, solid wall boundary, and empty\\nboundary.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to set up an OpenFOAM case for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil at 10° angle of attack using the k-omega SST model in OpenFOAM-v2406. They provided specific details from a research paper and a JSON structure with initial and boundary conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the necessary parameters from the paper. The paper mentions Mach 0.15, Re=6e6, and using OpenFOAM's simpleFoam solver. The turbulence models compared were Spalart-Allmaras and a new model, but the user wants to use kOmegaSST instead.\n\nThe user specified the files needed: system/fvSolution, 0/nut, 0/U, 0/omega, system/controlDict, 0/p, 0/k, constant/turbulenceProperties, constant/transportProperties, and system/fvSchemes. \n\nStarting with the controlDict, the application should be simpleFoam. The endTime and writeInterval need to be set appropriately for a steady-state simulation. The paper didn't specify these, so I'll use typical values like endTime 1000 and writeInterval 500.\n\nFor turbulenceProperties, the simulation is RAS with kOmegaSST. The RASProperties and turbulence must be on with printCoeffs enabled.\n\nTransportProperties requires kinematic viscosity (nu). Given Re=6e6, chord length c=1m, velocity U=51.3 m/s (calculated from Mach 0.15 at 300K), nu = (U*c)/Re = (51.3*1)/6e6 ≈ 8.55e-6 m²/s. Wait, but the user's initial conditions have U as [51.3, 9.04, 0], which is the velocity components at 10° angle of attack. The nu calculation should be checked again. Re=6e6 = (U*c)/nu → nu = U*c/Re. If U is the magnitude, sqrt(51.3² +9.04²) ≈52 m/s. So nu=52*1/6e6≈8.6667e-6. But the user's initial nut is 2.45e-2, which is turbulent viscosity. The transportProperties should have nu as the kinematic viscosity, which is correct here.\n\nNext, boundary conditions. The user provided a JSON with boundaries: airfoil, inlet, outlet. For each 0/* file, the internalField and boundary conditions must align. For U, the airfoil is fixedValue [0,0,0], inlet is freestreamVelocity with the given vector, outlet the same as inlet. p has zeroGradient on the airfoil and freestreamPressure elsewhere. \n\nFor k and omega, initial and boundary conditions need to be set. The kOmegaSST model requires k and omega fields. The inlet for k and omega can be estimated using turbulence intensity and length scale. However, the user didn't provide these, so perhaps using reasonable estimates. For omega, using a freestream value based on U and turbulence length scale. But since the user's initial conditions don't specify k and omega, but the JSON includes nut and nuTilda (which is for S-A model), but we're using k-omega SST, so nuTilda isn't needed. Wait, the user's JSON includes nuTilda, but in their case, they're using kOmegaSST, so maybe that's a mistake. The user's initial conditions include nut and nuTilda, but for kOmegaSST, we need k and omega instead of nuTilda. So the 0 directory should have k, omega, nut, U, p. The nuTilda is for the S-A model, so in this case, it's not needed. Therefore, the user might have included it by mistake, but we'll follow their JSON but adjust for kOmegaSST.\n\nWait, the user's JSON has initial_conditions for nut and nuTilda, but in the kOmegaSST case, we don't use nuTilda. So the 0/nuTilda file isn't required. The user's file list includes 0/nut, which is correct because nut is the turbulent viscosity used in many models, including kOmegaSST. So in the 0 directory, we need U, p, nut, k, omega.\n\nThe nut file's boundary conditions: airfoil uses nutLowReWallFunction, inlet and outlet as freestream. The initial nut value is 2.45e-2.\n\nFor k and omega, the initial conditions need to be set. The user's JSON doesn't specify k and omega, so we have to derive them. Let's calculate based on the given nut. The turbulent viscosity nut = k/(omega). But without k and omega, we need to assume some values. Alternatively, using the turbulence intensity and length scale. Let's assume a turbulence intensity of 5% (typical for such simulations). Then, k = 1.5*(U_ref*I)^2, where I is turbulence intensity. U_ref is the freestream velocity magnitude, which is sqrt(51.3² +9.04²) ≈52 m/s. So k=1.5*(52*0.05)^2 ≈1.5*(2.6)^2≈1.5*6.76≈10.14 m²/s². Then, omega can be estimated as omega = sqrt(k)/(Cmu^0.25 * L), where Cmu is 0.09, and L is the turbulence length scale. Assuming L=0.07*c (common approximation), c=1m, so L=0.07m. Then omega = sqrt(10.14)/(0.09^0.25 *0.07) ≈3.18/(0.547*0.07)≈3.18/0.0383≈83 rad/s. But these are rough estimates. Alternatively, using the nut value: nut = k/omega → omega = k/nut. If k=10.14 and nut=2.45e-2, omega=10.14/0.0245≈413.8 rad/s. However, this might be too high. Maybe the initial nut is not consistent with k and omega. Alternatively, the user might have provided the initial nut value based on the S-A model, but for kOmegaSST, we need to set k and omega appropriately. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps set initial k and omega with freestream values based on the turbulence properties. Let's proceed with k=0.1 m²/s² and omega=1000 rad/s as initial guesses, then adjust the boundary conditions accordingly. The inlet for k and omega would be the same as the initial values. The airfoil uses kqRWallFunction for k and omegaWallFunction for omega.\n\nIn the 0/k file, the boundary conditions for the airfoil would be kqRWallFunction, and inlet/outlet as freestream with the specified value. Similarly for omega, the airfoil uses omegaWallFunction with a value based on the wall treatment.\n\nThe system/fvSchemes needs to have the discretization schemes. For steady-state, simpleFoam uses the SIMPLE algorithm. The div terms should use Gauss upwind for stability, and laplacian schemes with Gauss linear corrected.\n\nThe system/fvSolution includes the solvers for each equation. For steady-state, typical solvers like smoothSolver for U, GAMG for p, etc. The SIMPLE algorithm settings like nNonOrthogonalCorrectors and residualControl.\n\nNow, putting all together, each file's content must adhere to the OpenFOAM syntax. The FoamFile headers are necessary, but the user doesn't want the decorative comments. Each file's class and object must be correct. For example, 0/U is a volVectorField, and so on.\n\nValidating the boundary conditions against the user's JSON. The airfoil has U as fixedValue [0,0,0], p as zeroGradient, nut as nutLowReWallFunction, k as kqRWallFunction, omega as omegaWallFunction. Inlet and outlet use freestream conditions with the given values.\n\nFinally, ensuring that all files are correctly structured, with proper FoamFile headers, and all boundary conditions match the user's specifications. Also, check that the application in controlDict is simpleFoam, and the turbulence model is set to kOmegaSST.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided an error message stating that the keyword 'wallDist' is undefined in the fvSchemes dictionary. The error occurs when the simulation is trying to access this keyword but can't find it. \n\nFirst, I need to remember what the 'wallDist' entry does in OpenFOAM. The wallDist is related to the wall distance calculation, which is necessary for certain turbulence models, especially those that require the distance to the nearest wall for functions like wall functions or near-wall treatments. The k-Omega SST model does use wall functions, so it's likely that the wall distance calculation is needed here.\n\nLooking at the provided fvSchemes file, I check if there's a section for 'wallDist'. The user's fvSchemes doesn't have any mention of wallDist. In OpenFOAM, the fvSchemes dictionary needs to specify the method for calculating the wall distance. Common methods are 'meshWave' or 'advectionDiffusion'. If this entry is missing, the solver can't compute the wall distance, leading to a fatal error.\n\nSo, the root cause is the absence of the 'wallDist' entry in the fvSchemes file. To fix this, the user needs to add the wallDist scheme under the appropriate section in fvSchemes. The correct approach is to include a block like:\n\nwallDist\n{\n    method meshWave;\n}\n\nThis tells OpenFOAM to use the meshWave method to calculate the wall distance. Without this, the turbulence model (kOmegaSST) can't find the required wall distance information, hence the error.\n\nTherefore, the wrong file is system/fvSchemes, and the advice is to add the wallDist entry with a valid method.\n",

The error message says that the keyword 'div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U)))))' is undefined in the divSchemes dictionary of the fvSchemes file. The error is occurring in the system/fvSchemes/divSchemes section from lines 21 to 23.\n\nLooking at the provided case files, especially the system/fvSchemes content, I need to check the divSchemes section. The user's fvSchemes file has a line: div((nuEff*dev2(T(gradU)))) Gauss linear;. Wait, the error mentions 'grad(U)' but in the case file, it's written as 'gradU'. That's probably the issue. OpenFOAM uses grad(U) with parentheses around the U, so grad(U) is correct. The current entry uses gradU without parentheses, which is incorrect syntax. The correct term should be grad(U), so the div scheme should be div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U))))) instead of gradU. \n\nTherefore, the wrong file is system/fvSchemes. The fix is to correct the typo in the divSchemes entry, replacing gradU with grad(U). This would resolve the undefined keyword error because the correct syntax is necessary for OpenFOAM to recognize the term.\n",

Wait, the error message says the keyword is 'div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U)))))' but in their file, it's written as 'gradU' without parentheses around U. That's probably the issue. OpenFOAM is strict about syntax, so the correct term should be 'grad(U)' instead of 'gradU'.\n\nLooking at the sample files from the tutorials, like sample_file_4 and sample_file_5, they use 'grad(U)' inside the div term. So the user needs to correct the typo from 'gradU' to 'grad(U)'.\n\nAdditionally, in the sample files, there's a 'div(phi,nuTilda)' entry. The user's case uses the k-omega SST model, which might require specifying schemes for turbulence variables like k and omega. However, their current fvSchemes doesn't have entries for div(phi,k) or div(phi,omega). But the error is specifically about the nuEff term, so maybe adding those turbulence terms isn't necessary unless other errors pop up. The main fix here is correcting the typo in the existing div scheme.\n\nSo the step-by-step fix would be to edit the divSchemes entry from 'gradU' to 'grad(U)', ensuring the syntax matches what OpenFOAM expects. That should resolve the undefined keyword error.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error because the keyword 'div(phi,omega)' is undefined in their fvSchemes file under divSchemes. The error message points to lines 21-23 in the divSchemes section. Let me check the provided fvSchemes content.\n\nLooking at their current divSchemes setup, they have entries for div(phi,U) and the nuEff term, but nothing for omega. Since they're using the k-Omega SST turbulence model, the solver probably requires a divergence scheme for omega. The sample files from the tutorials (like sample_file_6 and 15) show that when using omega or nuTilda, they include a line like div(phi,omega) or div(phi,nuTilda) with a scheme, often referencing a turbulence variable.\n\nThe user's initial and boundary conditions mention nuTilda, but the error is about omega. Wait, maybe they're using a different model. The turbulence model here is kOmegaSST, which uses omega, not nuTilda. But the initial conditions have nuTilda, which might be a mistake. However, the error is about omega, so the fvSchemes must include div(phi,omega).\n\nThe current divSchemes in the user's file don't have that entry. The solution is to add a line for div(phi,omega) in the divSchemes section. Looking at sample_file_15, they use a turbulence variable and assign div(phi,omega) to $turbulence. Similarly, sample_file_6 uses $turbulence for nuTilda. So, the user should define a turbulence scheme and reference it for omega.\n\nIn their divSchemes, add a turbulence entry like 'turbulence      bounded Gauss limitedLinear 1;' then set div(phi,omega) to $turbulence. That way, it's consistent with other turbulence terms and avoids the undefined keyword error.\n\nAlso, check that the existing entries don't conflict. The user has 'div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U))))) Gauss linear;' which is fine. The default is 'none', which is correct as all required terms should be explicitly set.\n\nSo, the fix is to add the turbulence definition and include div(phi,omega) using that scheme. This should resolve the error without altering initial or boundary conditions.\n",

    "assistant_response": "\n\n{\n  \"wrong_file\": \"0/omega\",\n  \"advices_for_revision\": \"Replace omegaWallFunction with fixedValue for airfoil boundary in 0/omega. The kOmegaSST model requires omega to use low-Re wall treatment when nutLowReWallFunction is specified. Set airfoil boundary to: { type fixedValue; value $internalField; } to avoid FPE from invalid wall function coupling.\"\n}",
    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out what's causing this OpenFOAM error. The error message mentions a floating point exception (sigFpe), which usually happens due to division by zero or some invalid operation. The stack trace points to the symGaussSeidelSmoother in the kOmegaSST model's correct method. That suggests the turbulence model might be having issues during the solve.\n\nLooking at the case files provided, let's check the boundary conditions and solver settings. The turbulence model is kOmegaSST, so the omega field is important. The omega file has a wall function boundary condition (omegaWallFunction) on the airfoil. But wait, the kOmegaSST model typically requires omega to be set with a low-Reynolds treatment near walls, not the wall function. Using omegaWallFunction might be incorrect here because the kOmegaSST model in OpenFOAM often uses nutLowReWallFunction, which pairs with omega's fixed value based on the low-Re approach.\n\nIn the 0/omega file, the airfoil boundary is set to omegaWallFunction. That's probably the issue. The correct boundary condition for omega when using low-Re turbulence treatment (as indicated by nutLowReWallFunction in 0/nut) should be a fixedValue with a calculated omega based on the near-wall grid spacing. The omegaWallFunction is more suited for high-Re cases where wall functions are appropriate. Mismatching these could lead to division by zero or invalid values during the solution process, causing the FPE.\n\nSo the wrong file is 0/omega. The fix would be to change the airfoil boundary type from omegaWallFunction to fixedValue with a value derived from the wall distance. For example, using omega = 60*nu/(beta1*dy^2), where dy is the first cell height. But since the exact grid isn't known, advising a fixedValue with a reasonable initial value and ensuring the mesh has a y+ < 1 for low-Re models would be the way to go.\n",

The stack trace points to issues in the solver's calculations, maybe division by zero or invalid operations.\n\nThen, Error 2 is an IO error because the keyword 'div(phi,omega)' isn't defined in the fvSchemes/divSchemes file. The solver expects this entry but can't find it, causing a fatal error.\n\nError 3 is similar to Error 2 but with a different keyword: 'div((nuEff*dev2(T(grad(U)))))' is missing in the same divSchemes dictionary. Again, this is an IO error due to an undefined keyword.\n\nNow, checking if the same error repeated three times. The first error is a runtime calculation error (FPE), while the next two are configuration errors related to missing entries in the fvSchemes. Each error is distinct: Error 1 is a numerical issue during solving, Error 2 and 3 are setup mistakes. Although Errors 2 and 3 are both IO errors in the same file, they reference different missing keywords. So, they are different errors. Therefore, none of the three errors are the same.

This fix maintains paper-specified nut/nuTilda while providing physically consistent omega initialization and stable BCs per k-omega SST requirements.",
    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided an error log and the omega file, and they need a fix without changing initial or boundary conditions from the paper. \n\nFirst, the error is a floating point exception (sigFpe) during the symGaussSeidelSmoother in the kOmegaSST model. Common causes for FPE in CFD are division by zero or invalid operations, often from incorrect turbulence variables.\n\nLooking at the omega file: internalField is uniform 1000. The boundary for airfoil uses omegaWallFunction with value 1000. Inlet and outlet are freestream with 1000. But the paper specifies initial conditions for nuTilda and nut, not omega. The k-Omega SST model requires both k and omega to be set correctly. Maybe omega's initial value is too high, causing division by a very small number in turbulence calculations. \n\nIn the tutorials, omega often uses calculated values based on turbulence properties. For example, in sample_file_5, they include an initialCondition file. The user's omega is set to 1000 uniformly, which might not align with the nut and nuTilda values. Let's check the relationship between omega, nut, and k. \n\nnut = k/(omega). If the user set nut to 2.45e-2, then k should be nut * omega. Here, k would be 2.45e-2 * 1000 = 24.5, which might be too high. Alternatively, if the initial k is not set properly, omega could be causing issues. Maybe the initial omega is too high, leading to very low k and division by zero. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute omega based on the given nut and k. However, the user's case might not have k defined. The paper's initial conditions don't mention k or omega, but since they're using kOmegaSST, both are needed. The error could be because omega is not compatible with the other turbulence variables.\n\nThe solution is to set omega based on the turbulence model's requirements. For the k-Omega SST model, a common approach is to estimate omega using the formula omega = sqrt(k)/(Cmu^0.25 * L), where L is a length scale. Alternatively, using freestream values based on turbulence intensity and length scale. \n\nBut the user can't change initial or boundary conditions per the paper. Wait, the paper's initial conditions have nuTilda and nut, but the case uses kOmegaSST which uses k and omega. Maybe there's a mismatch in the model setup. Wait, nuTilda is used in the Spalart-Allmaras model, not k-Omega. So the user might have a configuration error, using the wrong turbulence model. But the error is in kOmegaSST::correct(), so the model is active. That suggests the initial conditions for omega are incorrect, leading to a FPE during solving.\n\nTo fix this without changing the initial/boundary conditions from the paper, perhaps adjust omega's initial value based on the given nut and a reasonable k. For example, if nut = k/omega, then omega = k/nut. If k is estimated based on turbulence intensity, say k = 1.5*(U*I)^2, where U is velocity magnitude and I is intensity. Assuming a low intensity like 1%, U is around sqrt(51.3^2 + 9.04^2) ≈ 52 m/s. Then k ≈ 1.5*(52*0.01)^2 ≈ 0.4056. Then omega = 0.4056 / 2.45e-2 ≈ 16.56. But the user's omega is 1000, which is way higher. This would make k = nut*omega = 2.45e-2 * 1000 = 24.5, which might be causing instability.\n\nTherefore, the omega initial value should be adjusted to a more reasonable value based on the provided nut. Since the paper sets nut to 2.45e-2, calculate omega based on a reasonable k. However, the user can't change the initial omega's uniform value as per the paper. Wait, the paper's JSON doesn't specify omega's initial condition. Wait, the user's provided JSON initial_conditions include 'nut' and 'nuTilda', but the case uses kOmegaSST which requires 'k' and 'omega'. This is a conflict because the model expects k and omega, but the initial conditions provided are for nut and nuTilda. That might be the root issue. \n\nWait, nuTilda is specific to the SA model, while nut is the turbulent viscosity. If the user is using kOmegaSST, they should have initial conditions for k and omega, not nuTilda. So there's a mistake in the setup: the turbulence model in the case (kOmegaSST) doesn't match the initial conditions provided (which are for SA model). This mismatch would cause the solver to expect k and omega fields but they're missing or incorrectly initialized, leading to errors. \n\nBut the user's error is in the kOmegaSST correct() function, which implies the case is correctly using that model. However, the initial conditions from the paper are for a different model. Therefore, the user must have set up the case with the wrong initial conditions. The omega field's initial value is set to 1000, but without a proper k field, this could be causing invalid turbulence variables.\n\nThe solution is to set initial k and omega based on the provided nut and other parameters. Since the user can't change the initial conditions, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. The paper's initial conditions might be for a different model, but the case uses kOmegaSST. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute k and omega based on the given nut and other flow parameters.\n\nAlternatively, if the user intended to use the SA model but mistakenly used kOmegaSST, that's another issue. But given the error is in kOmegaSST, the model is active. Thus, the omega initial value is incorrect. The fix is to adjust omega's initial value to a compatible one with the given nut. For example, if nut = 0.0245, then omega should be set such that k = nut * omega, and also considering the turbulence model's constraints. However, without k's initial value, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, use the freestream turbulence conditions. For external aerodynamics, a common approach is to set omega based on turbulence length scale. For example, omega = epsilon/(Cmu*k), where epsilon = Cmu^(3/4)*k^(3/2)/L. But without knowing L, it's hard. Alternatively, use omega = U/(L), where L is a characteristic length. If L is 0.01 m, then omega = 50 / 0.01 = 5000. But the user's omega is 1000. Maybe the initial omega is too low or high.\n\nAnother approach: Check OpenFOAM's kOmegaSST documentation. The model requires that omega is positive and not zero. The wall function for omega should be compatible. The user's omegaWallFunction might be causing issues. Also, the freestream BC for omega at inlet/outlet might be incorrect. Instead of 'freestream', they should use 'inletOutlet' or 'fixedValue' with appropriate values.\n\nIn the sample files, the omega boundary for inlet often uses fixedValue, and outlet uses inletOutlet or zeroGradient. The user's inlet and outlet are set to 'freestream' type, which might not be suitable. The 'freestream' type requires a freestreamValue, but perhaps in this context, using 'inletOutlet' with a freestreamValue and inletValue is better. \n\nSo, revising the omega file:\n\n1. Change inlet and outlet boundary types from freestream to inletOutlet or fixedValue, referencing the tutorials. For example, sample_file_5 uses inletOutlet for outlet with $internalField. The freestream might not be correctly applied, leading to invalid omega values during solving.\n\n2. Adjust the internalField of omega to a value compatible with the given nut. Since nut = 2.45e-2 and nut = k/omega, but k is unknown. Assume a turbulence intensity (e.g., 1%) to estimate k, then compute omega. For example, U = 51.3 m/s, I = 1%, so k = 1.5*(U*I)^2 = 1.5*(51.3*0.01)^2 ≈ 0.397. Then omega = k/nut = 0.397 / 0.0245 ≈ 16.2. Set internalField to 16.2. But the user can't change the initial conditions per the paper. Wait, the paper's initial conditions don't mention omega, so this might be allowed as it's part of the turbulence model setup.\n\nBut the user's provided omega file has internalField 1000, which may be causing the error. Therefore, the correct step is to adjust the internalField of omega to a value that aligns with the given nut and estimated k. Since the paper doesn't specify omega, this adjustment is permissible.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate a suitable initial omega value based on nut and k. Using k = nut * omega, but without k, estimate k via turbulence intensity. Then set omega accordingly.\n\n2. Change the inlet and outlet boundary conditions for omega from freestream to inletOutlet or fixedValue, as per the tutorials, to avoid invalid values during solving.\n\n3. Ensure the omegaWallFunction on the airfoil is correctly specified, using a wall function appropriate for k-Omega SST.\n\nImplementing these changes should resolve the FPE by ensuring valid turbulence variables and proper boundary conditions.\n",

Let me check the provided 0/omega file.\n\nLooking at the boundaryField section for the inlet, the type is inletOutlet. The inletOutlet boundary condition typically requires both 'inletValue' and 'value' entries. But in the current setup, the user has 'freestreamValue' instead. Oh, right! For inletOutlet, the correct keyword is 'inletValue', not 'freestreamValue'. Using 'freestreamValue' here is a mistake because that's probably meant for other BC types like freestream. So replacing 'freestreamValue' with 'inletValue' should fix the error. Also, maybe the 'value' entry is missing, which is required for the outlet part when the flow reverses. But the error specifically mentions 'inletValue' is undefined, so the main issue is the wrong keyword. The fix is to correct that keyword in the inlet section of 0/omega.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, the user is getting a FOAM FATAL IO ERROR because the keyword 'inletValue' is undefined in the omega file's inlet boundary condition. Let me check the provided omega file.\n\nLooking at the omega boundaryField for inlet, the current type is inletOutlet. The error says 'inletValue' is missing. In OpenFOAM, the inletOutlet type requires both 'inletValue' and 'value' entries. The sample_file_3 from the tutorial uses inletOutlet with both. The user's file only has 'freestreamValue', which might be incorrect here.\n\nThe paper's boundary conditions for inlet specify 'freestream' for nut and nuTilda, but for omega, the correct approach depends on the turbulence model. Since it's k-omega SST, maybe using freestream isn't right. The tutorial sample_file_3 uses 'fixedValue' with a uniform value and 'inletOutlet' with 'inletValue'. The paper's initial conditions have omega as 742.85, which should be set correctly.\n\nSo the mistake is that the inlet boundary for omega is using 'inletOutlet' but missing 'inletValue'. The 'freestreamValue' is not a valid keyword for inletOutlet. The correct entries should be 'inletValue' and 'value'. Also, the 'type' might need to be 'fixedValue' if it's supposed to set a specific value, but according to the paper, maybe 'freestream' isn't the right type here. However, the paper's BC for omega isn't directly given, but the initial condition is uniform 742.85. The tutorial samples using 'fixedValue' for inlet.\n\nWait, the paper's boundary conditions for inlet in nut is 'freestream', but omega isn't mentioned. So perhaps for omega, the inlet should be 'fixedValue' with the initial value. Alternatively, maybe 'inletOutlet' is intended, but then both 'inletValue' and 'value' are needed. The user's current setup has 'freestreamValue', which is invalid. So replacing 'freestreamValue' with 'inletValue' and adding 'value' should fix it. The correct entries would be:\n\ninlet\n{\n    type            inletOutlet;\n    inletValue      uniform 742.85;\n    value           uniform 742.85;\n}\n\nThis matches the sample_file_3 where 'inletValue' is used with 'inletOutlet'. The 'freestreamValue' was a typo or incorrect keyword. Also, ensure the uniform value matches the initial condition. This change addresses the missing 'inletValue' keyword causing the error.\n",

Replace the outlet block with: \n\nboundaryField\n{\n    outlet\n    {\n        type            inletOutlet;\n        inletValue      uniform 742.85;\n        value           uniform 742.85;\n    }\n}\n\nThis adds the required 'inletValue' keyword while preserving the initial conditions and boundary specifications from the paper. The 'value' field is retained to match OpenFOAM's requirement for inletOutlet boundaries.",
    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error saying that the keyword 'inletValue' is undefined in the outlet boundary condition of the omega file. The error points to the outlet entry in the boundaryField section.\n\nLooking at the provided omega file, the outlet is defined with type 'inletOutlet' and has 'freestreamValue uniform 742.85', but no 'inletValue' entry. The OpenFOAM documentation says that the inletOutlet boundary type requires both 'inletValue' and 'value' entries. The error occurs because 'inletValue' is missing in the outlet definition.\n\nThe user also provided a sample_file_1 from the tutorials where the outlet uses inletOutlet with both 'inletValue' and 'value'. That's a good reference. The paper's boundary conditions for the outlet specify 'freestream' types, but since omega isn't mentioned, we can adjust based on standard OpenFOAM practices without violating the paper's constraints.\n\nSo the fix should be adding the 'inletValue' to the outlet. The existing 'freestreamValue' might be a typo. Replace 'freestreamValue' with 'inletValue' and include the 'value' field if missing. Let me check the current outlet entry again. The user's outlet has 'freestreamValue', which is incorrect. The correct entries for inletOutlet are 'inletValue' and 'value'. So changing 'freestreamValue' to 'inletValue' and adding 'value' if necessary. Wait, in the user's file, the outlet has 'type inletOutlet; freestreamValue uniform 742.85;'. But the correct parameters are 'inletValue' and 'value'. The sample_file_1 shows 'inletValue $internalField; value $internalField;'. Therefore, replacing 'freestreamValue' with 'inletValue' and adding 'value' line. Also, ensure the value matches the required condition. Since the initial conditions have omega's internalField as uniform 742.85, setting inletValue and value to the same makes sense. So the corrected outlet block should be:\n\noutlet\n{\n    type            inletOutlet;\n    inletValue      uniform 742.85;\n    value           uniform 742.85;\n}\n\nThis adds the missing 'inletValue' and includes 'value', which was present in the sample files. The 'freestreamValue' was a mistake; it should be 'inletValue'. This change aligns with the OpenFOAM requirements for the inletOutlet type without altering the initial or boundary conditions specified in the paper, as omega's conditions aren't explicitly mentioned there. The user's initial and boundary conditions for other variables like U, p, nut, and nuTilda are maintained as per the paper.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided a runtime error log and their case files. The error is a floating point exception (sigFpe), which often happens due to division by zero or invalid operations. The stack trace points to the symGaussSeidelSmoother in the kOmegaSST correct method.\n\nLooking at the case files, let's check the boundary conditions and solver settings. The turbulence model is kOmegaSST, which is sensitive to initial conditions and boundary setups. \n\nFirst, examining the '0/omega' file. The omegaWallFunction is used on the airfoil. But for kOmegaSST, the omega wall function might need specific settings. Wait, in OpenFOAM, when using kOmegaSST with low-Re turbulence (like nutLowReWallFunction), the omega boundary should be omegaWallFunction, but maybe the value is too high, causing division by zero. The internalField for omega is 742.85, which seems high. Let me check the formula for omega. Omega is k/(nu*T), where T is a time scale. If the initial omega is too high, it could lead to very small time scales, causing numerical issues.\n\nAlso, the '0/k' file uses kqRWallFunction. For kOmegaSST, the correct wall function for k is kLowReWallFunction or kqRWallFunction might not be suitable here. Wait, kqRWallFunction is for rough walls, but here it's a smooth airfoil. Maybe using the wrong wall function for k could lead to invalid k values near the wall, leading to negative values or zero, which when used in omega calculations (since omega ~ k/(nu*T)) could cause division by zero.\n\nAnother point: the '0/nut' uses nutLowReWallFunction. For SST models, typically nutUSpaldingWallFunction is used, but maybe with low-Re it's okay. However, combining nutLowRe with omegaWallFunction might require specific handling. Also, the initial nut value is 2.45e-2; check if that's appropriate with the given nu (8.55e-06). Maybe the turbulent viscosity is too high, leading to instability.\n\nLooking at the solver settings in fvSolution: The U, k, and omega use smoothSolver with symGaussSeidel. Maybe the solver tolerances are too relaxed (relTol 0.1), causing the solution to diverge quickly. Tightening the tolerances or switching to a more robust solver like PBiCGStab with DILU preconditioner might help.\n\nBut the key error is in the symGaussSeidelSmoother during the kOmegaSST correct step. This suggests the turbulence model is encountering invalid values. The root cause is likely incorrect boundary conditions for omega or k, leading to invalid turbulence variables. The most probable fix is adjusting the omega boundary condition. For the airfoil boundary, omega should have a fixed value based on the near-wall treatment. Using omegaWallFunction with a value derived from the wall distance (e.g., omega = 60 nu / (beta* y^2)) where y is the first cell height. But the user set it to a uniform 742.85, which might not align with the actual mesh, leading to very high omega values near the wall, causing division by zero in the SST model.\n\nTherefore, the '0/omega' file's boundary condition for the airfoil should use a calculated omegaWallFunction instead of a fixed uniform value. The inlet/outlet using inletOutlet might be okay, but the omegaWallFunction needs proper setup. Changing the airfoil's omega boundary from 'uniform 742.85' to a calculated wall function would provide appropriate omega values based on the mesh, preventing the FPE.\n",

Error 1 is a numerical runtime error. Errors 2 and 3 are both configuration/input errors but in different boundary fields. Since the Fatal IO Errors are about the same missing keyword but in different locations, they might be considered the same type of error but in different contexts. However, strictly speaking, each is in a different boundary (outlet and inlet), so they are two distinct errors. The first error is a runtime numerical issue, and the next two are setup/config errors. So, none of the three are the same error repeated three times. Error 2 and 3 are two instances of missing inletValue, but in different places. Error 1 is a different type altogether.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out why the OpenFOAM simulation is crashing with that floating-point exception (sigFpe). The error occurs in the symGaussSeidelSmoother during the solution of the omega equation, which is part of the kOmegaSST model. \n\nFirst, looking at the provided omega file. The internalField is set to uniform 742.85, and the boundary conditions for airfoil use omegaWallFunction. The inlet and outlet are both inletOutlet with the same value. The paper's initial conditions mention nuTilda and nut, but omega isn't directly listed. However, the k-omega SST model requires both k and omega to be initialized properly.\n\nThe error might be due to invalid or zero/negative values in omega during the solution. The Gauss-Seidel solver could be dividing by a very small or negative omega, causing a floating-point error. The initial value of 742.85 might be too low, leading to division by a small number in the turbulence model equations.\n\nLooking at the OpenFOAM tutorials, sample_file_3 initializes omega with a higher value (10.0) and uses fixedValue at the inlet with inletOutlet at the outlet. The current setup uses inletOutlet for both inlet and outlet, which might not be appropriate. For omega, the inlet should likely be fixedValue with a calculated freestream value, while the outlet uses inletOutlet. Also, the wall function for omega on the airfoil is correct, but the initial value might not be compatible with the turbulence model's requirements.\n\nThe paper's initial conditions specify nuTilda and nut, but for k-omega SST, omega should be derived from the turbulence properties. The initial omega value should be based on the freestream velocity and turbulent length scales. Using a uniform value that's too low could cause instability. The tutorials often use higher values, like 181728 in sample_file_2, which might be more stable.\n\nSo, the fix should adjust the initial omega to a higher value compatible with the k-omega SST model, ensure proper boundary conditions (fixedValue at inlet, inletOutlet at outlet), and use expressions that relate omega to the turbulence variables like nut or nuTilda. The boundary conditions must not violate the paper's constraints, which specify freestream values for inlet/outlet. The airfoil's omegaWallFunction is correct as per the paper's nutLowReWallFunction for nut, which pairs with omegaWallFunction.\n",

Revise 0/omega's internalField to a physically realistic value (e.g., ~3000 for airfoil flows) and ensure boundary conditions use fixedValue on walls with omegaWallFunction. Check consistency between k, omega, and nut fields via nut = k/(omega + small) to prevent floating-point exceptions.\"}",
    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided the error log and the case files. The error is a floating point exception (FPE), which usually points to division by zero or invalid operations. The stack trace shows it's happening in the symGaussSeidelSmoother during the kOmegaSST model correction. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the turbulence model setup. The turbulenceProperties file uses RAS with kOmegaSST, which is correct. Next, check the initial and boundary conditions for the turbulence fields: k, omega, and nut.\n\nLooking at 0/k: internalField is 0.1, which is okay. The boundary for airfoil uses kqRWallFunction. Wait, kqRWallFunction is typically for k-epsilon models. For kOmegaSST, the correct wall function for k should be kLowReWallFunction, especially if using low-Re settings. But here, the nut file uses nutLowReWallFunction, which suggests a low-Reynolds setup. However, the k boundary might be incorrectly specified.\n\nThen, 0/omega: internalField is 181728. That's a very high value. Let me calculate the initial omega for a typical case. Omega is usually calculated as sqrt(k)/(Cmu^0.25 * L), where L is a length scale. If k is 0.1, and assuming a small length scale (like 0.001m), omega could be around 3162.28 (sqrt(0.1)/(0.3*0.001)), but 181k seems way too high. Maybe the initial omega is set incorrectly, leading to division by zero in the solver.\n\nAlso, in the 0/omega boundary, the airfoil uses omegaWallFunction. For kOmegaSST with low-Re, omega should have a fixedValue with a small epsilon, not a wall function. Wait, no—kOmegaSST uses Menter's wall functions, so maybe omegaWallFunction is correct. But if the initial omega value is too high, it might cause the turbulence equations to blow up immediately.\n\nAnother thing: the transportProperties has nu=8.55e-06, which is about the kinematic viscosity of air. The inlet velocity is around 51 m/s, so the Reynolds number would be high. But if the mesh near the wall isn't fine enough for a low-Re model, that's a problem. Using nutLowReWallFunction requires y+ < 1, but if the mesh is coarse, this could cause issues. Alternatively, if the user intended to use wall functions, they should switch to nutkWallFunction and ensure proper y+ values.\n\nWait, the nut file has internalField 2.45e-2. Let me check: nut = k/(omega). If k=0.1 and omega=181728, then nut = 0.1 / 181728 ≈ 5.5e-7, but the internalField is set to 2.45e-2. That's inconsistent. This suggests that the initial nut is not consistent with k and omega values, leading to incorrect turbulence viscosity and possible solver divergence.\n\nSo the main issues are:\n1. Incorrect initial omega value leading to very low nut, but the nut field is set to a higher value. This inconsistency might cause division by zero or negative values during solving.\n2. Possible incorrect wall functions for k or omega when using low-Re turbulence model.\n\nThe error occurs during the kOmegaSST correct step, which relies on these initial conditions. The FPE is likely due to a division by a very small number or zero in the turbulence equations, caused by the high omega value.\n\nThe wrong_file is 0/omega, because its internalField is set to an excessively high value. Correcting omega's initial value to something more reasonable (e.g., based on k and a reasonable length scale) would resolve the instability. Also, checking the boundary conditions for omega, ensuring that the wall function is appropriate for kOmegaSST.\n",

    "assistant_response": "\n\nThe error is caused by an invalid initial omega value leading to floating-point exceptions. The current omega internalField (181728) is excessively high, causing divergence. Correct the omega file as follows: Adjust the internalField to a realistic value compatible with the turbulence model. Set internalField uniform to 16.12 based on nut=0.0245 and estimated k=0.395 (k=1.5*(U*I)^2, I=1%, U=51.3). Ensure boundary conditions remain as specified: airfoil uses omegaWallFunction, inlet fixedValue, and outlet inletOutlet. This maintains initial/boundary conditions while resolving the FPE by providing a physically plausible omega.",
    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a floating point exception (FPE) when running simpleFoam with the k-Omega SST model. The error trace points to the symGaussSeidelSmoother during the solve, which often relates to invalid values in the solution variables, like division by zero or very large numbers.\n\nLooking at the provided omega file, the internalField is set to uniform 181728. The boundary conditions for the airfoil use omegaWallFunction. The initial conditions from the paper specify nuTilda as 2.6e-5 and nut as 2.45e-2, but omega's initial value isn't directly given. However, omega is part of the turbulence model, so its initial value must be compatible with the other parameters.\n\nThe FPE might be due to an incorrect initial omega value leading to unstable calculations. In the k-Omega SST model, omega is calculated as epsilon/(k*Cmu), but if the initial omega is too high or low, it could cause divergence. The uniform 181728 seems suspiciously high. Let me check typical omega values. For example, in the OpenFOAM tutorials, omega might be around 10-1000 depending on the case. A value of 1e5+ seems way too high, leading to very small time steps or divisions by zero.\n\nThe user also provided sample files from tutorials. Sample_file_1 and 5 use a variable $turbulentOmega, which is likely defined in an include file. This suggests that omega should be calculated based on other turbulence variables like nut, U, or the freestream conditions. For instance, in the k-Omega SST model, the initial omega can be estimated using the formula omega = sqrt(k)/(Cmu^(1/4) * L), where L is a length scale. Alternatively, using the relation nut = k/(omega), so omega = k/(nut). If the user's case has nut initialized as 2.45e-2, and assuming k is around (U^2 * turbulence intensity), but the initial k isn't provided. Wait, the initial conditions in the paper don't mention k or omega, but they do have nut and nuTilda. Hmm. Since the user is using k-Omega SST, maybe omega should be derived from nut and other parameters.\n\nWait, in the k-Omega model, nut = k/(omega). So if nut is 2.45e-2, then omega would be k / 2.45e-2. But k isn't given in the initial conditions. Alternatively, maybe the freestream omega is calculated based on the inlet velocity and turbulence properties. For example, using omega = epsilon/(Cmu*k), and epsilon could be estimated from the turbulence length scale. Alternatively, using the formula for freestream omega as omega = (U/L), where L is a characteristic length. If the user's omega is set to 181728, that's way too high. Let's see: if U is around 51.3 m/s (from the initial U), and a turbulence length scale of, say, 0.1 meters, omega would be around 513. Even that's high, but 181k is way higher. That could lead to very small time steps and FPE.\n\nSo the fix would be to adjust the initial omega value to a more reasonable number. The user must set omega based on the turbulence model's requirements. Looking at the sample files, they often use a calculated turbulentOmega. For example, in sample_file_3, omegaInlet is set to 10.0. So perhaps the user's omega is set way too high, causing the solver to crash.\n\nBut the user's paper's initial conditions don't specify omega, so how to proceed? The provided initial conditions for the case include U, p, nut, and nuTilda. Since the user is using the k-Omega SST model, omega needs to be initialized correctly. The nut value is given as 2.45e-2. If we can estimate k, then omega = k / nut. But how to get k? Alternatively, if using the k-Omega SST model, the freestream omega can be calculated using the formula omega = (U_ref)^2 / (nu * Re) or similar. Alternatively, using the relationship for the turbulence intensity and length scale. Let's assume turbulence intensity is low, say 1%, so k = 1.5*(U*I)^2. For U=51.3 m/s, I=1% gives k=1.5*(51.3*0.01)^2 ≈ 1.5*(0.513)^2 ≈ 0.395. Then omega = k / nut = 0.395 / 0.0245 ≈ 16.12. That's much lower than 181k. So setting omega to around 16 would be more reasonable. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in unit conversion or formula. The current omega value of 181728 is likely the root cause of the FPE.\n\nTherefore, correcting the internalField of omega to a lower value, like 16, would prevent the solver from encountering a floating point exception. Also, check the boundary conditions. The airfoil uses omegaWallFunction, which is correct. The inlet is fixedValue, which should match the initial condition. The outlet uses inletOutlet, which is appropriate. However, the value at the inlet and internalField should be set to a reasonable omega. The sample files use uniform $turbulentOmega, which suggests defining it via an include file. The user should define a proper turbulentOmega based on their flow conditions.\n\nSo the step-by-step fix is to adjust the internalField of omega to a value derived from the turbulence parameters, ensuring it's compatible with nut and the model's requirements. The exact value can be calculated using k = nut * omega, but since k isn't provided, estimating based on turbulence intensity or using a standard tutorial value (like 100-1000) might be necessary. Given the provided samples and the error context, setting omega to a much lower value, perhaps around 16, or even 100, would be better than 181k. The user should check the tutorial cases for similar setups to determine the appropriate omega.\n",

Set internalField uniform to 16.12 based on nut=0.0245 and estimated k=0.395 (k=1.5*(U*I)^2, I=1%, U=51.3).

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error analysis. The user provided an error log and the case files. The error is a floating point exception (sigFpe), which usually points to division by zero or some invalid arithmetic operation. Looking at the stack trace, it's happening in the symGaussSeidelSmoother during the solution of the kOmegaSST model. \n\nFirst, I need to check the boundary conditions for the turbulence fields like k, omega, and nut. The '0/omega' file has a wall function for the airfoil boundary. The kOmegaSST model can have issues with wall functions if not set up correctly. Wait, the '0/nut' file uses nutLowReWallFunction, which is for low-Reynolds simulations, but the turbulence model is kOmegaSST, which typically uses nutkWallFunction for high-Re. That's a conflict.\n\nAlso, the '0/omega' boundary condition for the airfoil is set to omegaWallFunction, but maybe the initial value of omega is too low, causing a division by zero. The internal field is 16.12, but perhaps the wall function requires a different approach. Alternatively, the initial values for k and omega might not be compatible, leading to negative values during solving.\n\nAnother point is the solver settings in 'system/fvSolution'. The smoothSolver with symGaussSeidel for U, k, and omega might not be stable enough. Maybe switching to a more robust solver like PBiCGStab with DILU preconditioner could help with convergence.\n\nWait, the '0/k' file uses kqRWallFunction. For kOmegaSST, the correct wall function for k is kZeroWallFunction. Using kqRWallFunction here might be incorrect. That's a possible issue. Also, checking the turbulence properties in 'constant/turbulenceProperties'—the model is correctly set to kOmegaSST, so that's not the problem.\n\nSo the main issues are likely the wall functions for k and nut not matching the turbulence model, and possibly the solver settings. The immediate fix would be to correct the boundary conditions for k and nut. For k, use kZeroWallFunction instead of kqRWallFunction. For nut, switch to nutkWallFunction instead of nutLowReWallFunction. Also, adjusting the initial values for k and omega to be more appropriate for the case might prevent division by zero. Additionally, tweaking the solver settings in fvSolution to use more robust solvers for turbulence variables could help avoid convergence issues leading to the FPE.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me look at these three error logs the user provided. They want to know if the same error has occurred three times.\n\nFirst, I'll check each error's stack trace. Error 1 starts with Foam::error::printStack, then sigFpe::sigHandler, which is a signal handler for floating point exceptions. The backtrace includes calls to symGaussSeidelSmoother::smooth, smoothSolver::solve, fvMatrix solve methods, and kOmegaSST::correct. The error message is a floating point exception (SIGFPE) when running simpleFoam.\n\nLooking at Error 2, the stack trace is identical. Same functions in the same order: printStack, sigFpe, symGaussSeidelSmoother, smoothSolver, fvMatrix solve, kOmegaSST correct. The error is also a SIGFPE in simpleFoam. The only differences are the process IDs (21097, 20974, 20729) and the paths, but those are just runtime instances.\n\nError 3 is exactly the same as the first two. Same sequence of function calls leading up to the SIGFPE in the same application. The core of the error is the same each time: a floating point exception during the solution process in the kOmegaSST turbulence model correction step using the symGaussSeidel smoother.\n\nAll three errors are triggered in the same part of the code, with the same call stack. The fact that each instance is a separate run (different process IDs) but the same setup (same case directory) suggests that the error is recurring under the same conditions. Since the user is asking if the error has repeated three times, and all three logs show the same error pattern, the answer should be yes.\n",

In 0/omega, revise internalField to a higher value (e.g., uniform 500) to avoid division-by-zero in turbulence equations. Change inlet boundary type from fixedValue to turbulentMixingLengthFrequencyInlet with mixingLength 0.01 and value matching internalField.\"\n}",
    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided a runtime error log and their case files. The error is a floating point exception (sigFpe), which often happens due to division by zero or invalid operations. The stack trace points to the symGaussSeidelSmoother in the kOmegaSST model's correct method. \n\nFirst, I need to check the boundary conditions and initial fields. Looking at the 0/omega file, the omegaWallFunction is used on the airfoil. The omegaWallFunction in kOmegaSST requires specific settings. If the initial omega value is too low, it might cause division by zero in the turbulence model calculations. The internalField for omega is 16.12. Let me verify the formula for omega in the kOmegaSST model.\n\nThe freestream omega can be estimated using omega = epsilon/(Cmu*k), but for kOmegaSST, a common approach is omega = U/(L), where L is a length scale. Alternatively, using omega = 10*U_infinity/(C) where C is chord length. If the initial omega is too small, it could lead to very high values in the turbulence equations, causing instability.\n\nWait, the user's omega is 16.12. Let's check the velocity. The U field is (51.3, 9.04, 0), so the magnitude is sqrt(51.3^2 + 9.04^2) ≈ 52 m/s. If the chord length is, say, 1m, omega could be around 10*52/1 = 520, but the user has 16.12. That seems too low. Maybe the initial omega is underestimated, leading to very high turbulent viscosity or other terms that cause division by zero.\n\nAnother possibility is the boundary conditions for omega. The airfoil uses omegaWallFunction, which should be correct, but the inlet has fixedValue. For omega in kOmegaSST, the inlet should typically use a turbulentMixingLengthFrequencyInlet or calculated based on turbulence intensity. A fixedValue might not be appropriate if the value isn't compatible with the turbulence model's requirements.\n\nAlso, check the nut boundary conditions. The airfoil uses nutkWallFunction, which is correct for kOmegaSST. The inlet and outlet are calculated, but maybe the initial nut value is problematic. However, the error occurs in the symGaussSeidelSmoother during the kOmegaSST correct step, so the issue is more likely in the turbulence model setup or initial/boundary conditions for k or omega.\n\nLooking at the 0/k file, the internalField is 0.1. Using k = (U * I)^2, where I is turbulence intensity. If I is 1%, then k ≈ (52 * 0.01)^2 ≈ 0.27. The user has 0.1, which is a bit low but maybe acceptable. However, combined with a low omega, the turbulent viscosity nut = k/(omega) would be 0.1/16.12 ≈ 0.0062, which might be okay. Wait, but in their 0/nut file, the internalField is set to 2.45e-2. Let me check: nut = k/(omega) would be 0.1/16.12 ≈ 0.0062, but they have 0.0245. That discrepancy suggests maybe the initial nut isn't consistent with k and omega. But the user set nut manually, which might not align with k and omega. However, during the solution, the turbulence model would recalculate nut, so this inconsistency might not be the main issue.\n\nThe error occurs during the solution step, so perhaps the problem is in the fvSolution settings. The solvers for U, p, k, omega are using smoothSolver with symGaussSeidel. The tolerance and relTol settings are standard. The SIMPLE residual controls are set to 1e-5 for p, U, and (k|omega). Maybe the solver is diverging because the initial residuals are too high, and the linear solver tolerances are too loose. However, the error is a floating point exception, which is more likely due to a NaN or Inf in the matrix solve.\n\nAnother angle: the fvSchemes for div terms. The div(phi,omega) uses a bounded scheme, which is correct. The turbulence model might require specific schemes. If the divergence scheme is too aggressive, it could cause instability. But the user's setup seems okay.\n\nWait, looking at the transportProperties: nu is 8.55e-06, which is about the kinematic viscosity of air. That's correct. The turbulenceProperties uses RAS with kOmegaSST, which is okay.\n\nPutting it all together, the most likely issue is the initial omega value being too low, leading to division by zero in the turbulence model equations. The user's omega is 16.12, but based on the velocity and length scale, it should be higher. For example, if the chord is 1m, omega ≈ 10*U / C = 10*52 / 1 = 520. So increasing omega to a higher value, like 500, might stabilize the solution. Alternatively, check the boundary conditions for omega at the inlet. Using fixedValue with a low omega might not be appropriate. The inlet should perhaps use a turbulentFrequencyInlet or calculated based on turbulence parameters.\n\nTherefore, the wrong_file is 0/omega. The advice is to increase the internalField value of omega and set the inlet boundary condition to a calculated or appropriate inlet type like turbulentMixingLengthFrequencyInlet to avoid division by zero in the turbulence model.\n",

The stack traces are almost identical across all three errors.\n\nLooking at the function calls, each error involves symGaussSeidelSmoother::smooth, smoothSolver::solve, fvMatrix solve methods, and the kOmegaSST model's correct function. The same libraries and binaries are referenced, like /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 and the simpleFoam executable. The only differences are the process IDs (21200, 21097, 20974) and the line numbers in the bash script, but the core error messages and stack traces are the same. \n\nSince all three errors show the same sequence of function calls leading to a FPE during the same simulation setup with kOmegaSST, it's clear the same error is recurring. No variations in the error cause are present. Therefore, the error has repetitively occurred three times.\n",

Update boundary conditions: airfoil should use nutkWallFunction with value 0, inlet/outlet should use calculated with uniform 0.0062 to match internal field.\"}",
    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided the runtime error log and the case files. The error is a floating point exception (sigFpe), which often happens due to division by zero, invalid operations, or solver convergence issues.\n\nLooking at the stack trace, the error occurs in the symGaussSeidelSmoother during the solve step for the kOmegaSST model. That points towards the turbulence model setup or the solver settings. \n\nFirst, I'll check the boundary conditions. The 0/omega file uses omegaWallFunction for the airfoil, which is correct. The inlet and outlet have fixedValue and inletOutlet, which might be okay, but maybe the initial omega value is too high or low. The internalField is 16.12. Let me recall the formula for omega in SST k-omega. Omega is k/(nu_t*Cmu), but if the initial nut is too low, omega could be very high, leading to division by zero.\n\nLooking at 0/nut, the internalField is 2.45e-2. Let's check if this is reasonable. The nu in transportProperties is 8.55e-06. So nut is about 2.45e-2, which is higher than nu, which is okay. But maybe the initial k and omega are not compatible. The 0/k has internalField 0.1. Using the relation for k-omega SST, the turbulent viscosity nut = k/(omega). So 0.1 / 16.12 ≈ 0.0062, but the nut is set to 0.0245. That's a discrepancy. This inconsistency might cause the turbulence model to compute invalid values, leading to a FPE.\n\nSo the initial nut value doesn't match the k and omega values. The correct nut should be k/(omega) = 0.1 / 16.12 ≈ 0.0062. But in 0/nut, it's set to 0.0245. This mismatch could cause the turbulence model to produce invalid values during the solve, triggering the floating point error.\n\nTherefore, the wrong_file is 0/nut. The advice is to correct the internalField of nut to be consistent with k and omega. Calculate nut as k/omega (0.1 / 16.12 ≈ 0.0062) and set that in 0/nut. Also, ensure boundary conditions for nut are appropriately set, perhaps using calculated or nutkWallFunction if needed.\n",

They start with Foam::error::printStack, then sigFpe::sigHandler. The next frames involve the symGaussSeidelSmoother in the smooth function, leading into the smoothSolver and fvMatrix solve methods. Then they go through the kOmegaSST::correct() function, which suggests the error is happening during the turbulence model correction step.\n\nComparing each error's stack trace line by line, the function calls and the order are identical across all three. The only differences are the process IDs (21303, 21200, 21097) and the timestamps, which are expected in separate runs. The core of the error—where it occurs in the code—is the same each time.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided a runtime error log and their case files. The error mentions a floating point exception (sigFpe) which often happens due to division by zero, invalid operations, or solver convergence issues.\n\nLooking at the stack trace, the error occurs in the symGaussSeidelSmoother during the kOmegaSST model's correct() method. That points towards turbulence model setup or boundary conditions for turbulence variables like k, omega, or nut.\n\nFirst, check the boundary conditions for omega. In the 0/omega file, the airfoil uses omegaWallFunction. But omegaWallFunction requires specific setup. If the initial omega value is too low, it might cause division by zero in the solver. The internalField is 16.12, which seems high, but maybe the wall function isn't set correctly.\n\nWait, the omegaWallFunction's value is set to $internalField, which might not be right. The omegaWallFunction should compute omega based on near-wall grid spacing, so setting a fixed value here could be invalid. The correct approach is to use a wall function that doesn't enforce a fixed value but calculates it based on the turbulence model. For example, using 'type omegaWallFunction;' without specifying 'value' might be better. But in OpenFOAM, some boundary conditions require the 'value' entry even if it's not used. Alternatively, maybe the user should not set a fixed value here.\n\nLooking at the k file, the airfoil uses kqRWallFunction. That's correct for k with wall functions. The nut file uses nutkWallFunction, which is appropriate. So maybe the omega boundary condition is the problem. The omegaWallFunction should not have a fixed value but instead compute omega based on the wall distance and other parameters. Setting 'value' to $internalField here might be causing an invalid omega value at the wall, leading to a division by zero in the turbulence model calculation.\n\nSo the fix would be to adjust the omega boundary condition on the airfoil. Instead of setting 'value' to $internalField, it should perhaps omit the value or set it to a more appropriate value based on the wall function. For omegaWallFunction, the 'value' entry is typically given a placeholder but isn't used during computation. However, OpenFOAM might require it to be present. Maybe setting it to a non-zero value, but the wall function should override it. Alternatively, perhaps the initial omega value is too high, leading to instability. Wait, the internalField for omega is 16.12. Let me check the k-omega SST model's requirements. The omega equation has terms involving k and omega, so if the initial omega is too low or high, it might cause issues. But the actual problem is more likely the boundary condition setup for omega on the airfoil. Using a fixedValue there with the internalField value would override the wall function's calculation, leading to incorrect values at the wall, which might cause the solver to compute invalid turbulence quantities (like negative values), triggering a floating point error.\n\nTherefore, the wrong file is 0/omega. The boundary condition for airfoil should not have a fixed value but use the omegaWallFunction correctly. The correct setup for omegaWallFunction typically does not specify a value, or uses a calculated value. However, in OpenFOAM, the omegaWallFunction requires the 'value' entry, but it might be better to set it to a non-zero value that's compatible with the wall function. Alternatively, the user might have to adjust the omega initial conditions to ensure that the near-wall values are computed correctly by the wall function.\n\nThe advice is to modify the airfoil boundary in 0/omega from fixedValue to omegaWallFunction without specifying a fixed value, or set a more appropriate value. But looking at the current setup, the airfoil boundary is already type omegaWallFunction, but the value is set to $internalField. That's incorrect because omegaWallFunction doesn't use the value entry in the same way. Instead, the value should be set using a wall function expression. However, in OpenFOAM's boundary files, you still need to provide a 'value' entry. The correct approach is to set the value to a reasonable initial guess for omega at the wall, perhaps using a small epsilon or based on turbulence intensity.\n\nWait, the user's current 0/omega file has:\n\nboundaryField\n{\n    airfoil\n    {\n        type            omegaWallFunction;\n        value           $internalField;\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nBut omegaWallFunction requires the 'value' to be specified, but it's not used during the simulation because the wall function computes omega based on the near-wall cell values. However, if the initial value here is too high or too low, it could cause issues in the first iteration before the wall function is applied. For example, if the internalField is 16.12, and the wall is set to the same value via $internalField, that might not be appropriate. The omega value at the wall should be much higher since omega is inversely proportional to the wall distance squared. So setting a high omega value at the wall (as per wall functions) is correct, but maybe the initial value here is conflicting with the wall function's calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user should use a calculated or zeroGradient type, but no, for omega, the correct type is omegaWallFunction. The mistake is in specifying the value as $internalField. Instead, the value should be set to a suitable value for the wall. For example, using a value based on the formula for omega in the wall function: omega = 6*nu/(beta1*y^2), where y is the near-wall cell distance. But since the user might not know y in advance, maybe using a placeholder or a very high value (approximating the wall condition) would be better.\n\nBut in practical OpenFOAM setups, for omegaWallFunction, you can set the 'value' to a uniform high value like 1e6, but in this case, the user has set it to 16.12, same as internalField. That might not be high enough, leading to invalid turbulence viscosity (nut) calculations, which could cause division by zero or negative values in the solver.\n\nSo to fix this, change the 'value' entry for the airfoil boundary in 0/omega to a much higher value, like 1e6, instead of $internalField. This ensures that the initial omega at the wall is sufficiently high to prevent division by zero in the turbulence model calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the omegaWallFunction is not compatible with the current setup. For example, if the mesh isn't fine enough near the wall for the wall function to be applicable, that could also cause issues. But the user's error is specifically a floating point exception during the solver's smoothing step, which is more likely due to invalid field values rather than mesh issues.\n\nTherefore, the wrong file is 0/omega, and the fix is to adjust the airfoil boundary's value to a high omega value compatible with the wall function, instead of using the internalField value.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's take a look at these three error histories. The user wants to know if the same error has occurred three times. \n\nFirst, I'll compare each error to see if they're identical. Starting with Error 1: the stack trace begins with Foam::error::printStack, then sigFpe::sigHandler, followed by a libc.so.6 entry. Then it goes into symGaussSeidelSmoother::smooth, smoothSolver::solve, fvMatrix solve functions, and the kOmegaSST model correct method. The error message mentions a floating-point exception (sigFpe) in simpleFoam.\n\nLooking at Error 2, the stack traces are exactly the same as Error 1. The same functions are called in the same order, leading up to the kOmegaSST::correct. The error is also a floating-point exception in simpleFoam with the same bash line message.\n\nError 3 follows the same pattern. The same sequence of Foam functions and libc entries. The only differences are the process IDs (21405, 21303, 21200) and the line numbers in the bash script, which probably just indicate different runs or times the error occurred. The core of the error—the functions involved and the exception type—are identical across all three.\n\nSince all three errors have the same stack trace structure, same exception type (sigFpe), and occur in the same part of the code (kOmegaSST model during solving), it's clear they are repetitive. The variations in process IDs and bash line numbers don't change the fact that the underlying error is the same each time. So, the answer should be yes.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user provided the runtime error log and the case files. The error is a floating point exception (sigFpe), which often happens due to division by zero or invalid operations. The stack trace points to the symGaussSeidelSmoother in the kOmegaSST model's correct method. \n\nFirst, I'll check the boundary conditions for the turbulence fields. The omega file has a wall function on the airfoil. The k file uses kqRWallFunction, which might be an issue. Wait, in OpenFOAM's kOmegaSST model, the correct wall function for k should be kLowReWallFunction if low-Reynolds treatment is needed, but typically for high-Re, it's nutUSpaldingWallFunction or similar. Also, the inlet and outlet for k and omega use freestream or fixedValue, which might be okay.\n\nLooking at the transportProperties, nu is set to 8.55e-06, which is reasonable for air. The turbulenceProperties specifies RAS with kOmegaSST, which is correct.\n\nNext, the fvSolution file. The solvers for U, p, k, omega. The U and p solvers look okay, but the k and omega use smoothSolver with symGaussSeidel. The kOmegaSST model can be sensitive to solver settings. Maybe the tolerance or relTol for k and omega are too aggressive, causing instability. The residualControl in SIMPLE is set to 1e-5 for all variables. If the initial residuals are high, this might lead to solver divergence, triggering a floating point error.\n\nThe fvSchemes: div schemes for turbulence are bounded Gauss limitedLinear 1. For k and omega, using upwind or limited linear might help stability. But the main issue could be the solver settings in fvSolution. The smoothSolver with high relTol (0.1) might not be converging properly, leading to NaNs. Switching to more robust solvers like PBiCGStab with DILU preconditioner for k and omega could help.\n\nAlso, the residualControl in SIMPLE might be too strict. Relaxing the residual criteria or increasing the tolerance in the solvers could prevent the FPE. For example, increasing the relTol for k and omega solvers or using a lower tolerance.\n\nSo, the wrong_file is likely system/fvSolution. The advice would be to adjust the solver settings for k and omega to more stable options, adjust tolerances, and possibly relax the residual control.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's take a look at these three error histories the user provided. The task is to determine if the same error has occurred three times. \n\nFirst, I'll start by reading through each error to spot any differences. Error 1, 2, and 3 all start with the same stack trace. The initial lines mention Foam::error::printStack and Foam::sigFpe::sigHandler, which are typical in OpenFOAM when a floating-point exception (FPE) occurs. The signal SIGFPE usually relates to division by zero or other invalid arithmetic operations.\n\nLooking at the stack traces, each error lists the same sequence of function calls. They all involve symGaussSeidelSmoother::smooth, smoothSolver::solve, fvMatrix::solveSegregated, and so on, leading up to the kOmegaSST model's correct method. The line numbers are missing (denoted by ??:?), but the function names and the order are identical across all three errors. \n\nThe only differences between the errors are the process IDs (21560, 21405, 21303) and the times they occurred, which are part of the system's logging but don't indicate a change in the error itself. The core message \"浮点数例外\" (floating-point exception) is consistent each time. \n\nSince all three errors originate from the same part of the code, specifically during the solution process using the kOmegaSST turbulence model with the symGaussSeidelSmoother, and the stack traces are identical, it's clear that the same error is repeating. There's no variation in the error cause or location mentioned. Therefore, the answer should be 'yes'.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's look at the error message. The user provided an OpenFOAM runtime error that says the keyword 'div(phi,k)' is undefined in the fvSchemes/divSchemes dictionary. The error points to lines 21 to 25 in the system/fvSchemes file. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why this error occurs. The divSchemes section in fvSchemes defines the divergence schemes for different terms. The kOmegaSST turbulence model requires a specific divergence scheme for the turbulent kinetic energy, k. If the case setup uses the k-epsilon or k-omega model, the div(phi,k) and div(phi,epsilon) or div(phi,omega) must be defined.\n\nLooking at the provided system/fvSchemes content, the divSchemes section includes entries for div(phi,U), turbulence, div(phi,omega), and a term with nuEff. However, there's no entry for div(phi,k). The turbulence model (kOmegaSST) likely requires both div(phi,k) and div(phi,omega) to be specified. Since the error mentions div(phi,k) is missing, that's the root cause.\n\nThe correct approach is to add the missing div(phi,k) entry in the divSchemes. The existing turbulence entry uses a variable 'turbulence' which is set to 'bounded Gauss limitedLinear 1'. Maybe they intended to use the same scheme for both k and omega. So, adding 'div(phi,k) $turbulence;' would reference the same scheme as div(phi,omega). Alternatively, explicitly setting the scheme for k.\n\nThe wrong file is definitely system/fvSchemes. The advice should guide the user to add the div(phi,k) line in divSchemes, using the same turbulence scheme as omega. Check that the syntax is correct and that the variable 'turbulence' is properly defined. Ensure there are no typos and that the line is placed correctly within the divSchemes block.\n",

The error message points to lines 21 to 25 in the divSchemes dictionary. \n\nLooking at the provided fvSchemes content, the divSchemes section has entries for div(phi,U), turbulence, div(phi,omega), and the nuEff term. But there's no entry for div(phi,k). The turbulence model being used here is kOmegaSST, which involves both k and omega equations. The kOmegaSST model requires a divergence scheme for the turbulent kinetic energy (k), so the absence of div(phi,k) is the root cause.\n\nIn the sample files from the tutorials, like sample_file_11 and sample_file_7, they have entries for div(phi,k) that reference the turbulence scheme. For example, 'div(phi,k) $turbulence;'. The user's current setup defines 'div(phi,omega)' using $turbulence but misses the k term. \n\nThe solution is to add the missing div(phi,k) entry in the divSchemes section. The turbulence scheme is already defined as 'bounded Gauss limitedLinear 1', so referencing it for both k and omega should be correct.

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°.

Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to extract the boundary conditions from the provided paper excerpts and validate them against the OpenFOAM boundary name list. The user specified to focus on the boundaries: outlet, inlet, and airfoil, and the fields: nut, U, omega, p, k. The paper mentions boundary conditions in Table 1 on page 6.\n\nLooking at Table 1 in the paper:\n- For the Airfoil (solid wall), the U is fixed-value, nut uses nutLowReWallFunction, and p is zero gradient.\n- Inlet/outlet boundaries have U as freestreamVelocity, p as freestreamPressure, nuTilda as freestream, and nut as freestream.\n- Front and back boundaries are empty.\n\nFirst, I need to map these to the correct OpenFOAM boundary types. The user wants only spelling corrections. The airfoil is a solid wall, so for the airfoil boundary:\n- U is fixedValue (correct spelling from fixed-value to fixedValue).\n- p is zeroGradient (correct from zero gradient).\n- nut is nutLowReWallFunction (as per the paper's 'nutLowReWallFunction').\n\nFor inlet and outlet:\n- The paper lists inlet/outlet as freestreamVelocity for U, freestreamPressure for p, and freestream for nuTilda and nut. Checking the OpenFOAM list, freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure are valid. The 'freestream' exists for nuTilda and nut.\n\nThe fields omega and k aren't mentioned in the paper's Table 1, so they might not be applicable here. The user specified to include only the given fields, so perhaps omega and k aren't used in this setup, or their BCs aren't detailed. Since the paper focuses on the S-A model and a new model, maybe omega and k aren't part of the models used here, hence not required.\n\nSo, compiling the validated BCs:\n- airfoil (wall):\n  - U: fixedValue (corrected from fixed-value)\n  - p: zeroGradient\n  - nut: nutLowReWallFunction\n- inlet:\n  - U: freestreamVelocity\n  - p: freestreamPressure\n  - nut: freestream\n- outlet:\n  - U: freestreamVelocity\n  - p: freestreamPressure\n  - nut: freestream\n\nThe fields omega and k aren't mentioned, so they might not be part of the simulation setup described, thus not included. The user instructed to only include the specified fields, so we leave out omega and k.\n",
