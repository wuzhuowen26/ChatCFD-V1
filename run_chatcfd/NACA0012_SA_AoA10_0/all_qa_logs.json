    "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to convert the provided JSON into a Markdown format following the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, each top-level key in the JSON should become a main heading with a #. The JSON given has \"Case_3\" as the top-level key. So, I'll start with \"# Case_3\".\n\nNext, the key-value pairs under Case_3 need to be unordered list items. Each of those keys like \"case_name\", \"solver\", etc., should be list items. The user wants the hierarchy maintained, but in this case, all the key-value pairs are direct children of Case_3, so they'll all be at the same level in the list.\n\nI need to check if any of the values are nested objects. Looking at the JSON, the value for \"Case_3\" is an object with several properties, but none of those properties are nested further. So each key under Case_3 will be a list item with a hyphen, like \"- case_name: NACA0012_SA_AoA10\".\n\nI should maintain the original order of the keys as they appear in the JSON. Let me list them out: case_name, solver, turbulence_model, other_physical_model, case_specific_description.\n\nEach of these becomes a list item. The case_specific_description has a longer value, but since it's just a string, it's still a single list item. I don't need any sub-lists here because there's no deeper hierarchy.\n\nLet me put it all together. The main heading is # Case_3, followed by each key-value as a list item. I'll make sure to use hyphens for the list and colons after the keys. Also, check for any special characters that might need escaping, but in this case, the descriptions seem okay.\n\nWait, the case_specific_description has some numbers like 10° which uses the degree symbol. In Markdown, that should be fine as is. No need to escape it. The rest of the punctuation like commas and parentheses should also be okay.\n\nSo the final Markdown should look like:\n\n# Case_3\n\n- case_name: NACA0012_SA_AoA10\n- solver: simpleFoam\n- turbulence_model: SpalartAllmaras\n- other_physical_model: none\n- case_specific_description: Steady-state simulation... (the rest of the description)\n\nI think that's it. Let me double-check the original JSON to ensure all key-value pairs are included and in the right order. Yep, looks good. No typos in the values. Alright, that should meet all the user's requirements.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14]. The specific\\nturbulence model equations are illustrated below.\\nThe fluctuation continuity equation is:\\nThe group average fluctuation velocity equation is:\\n( ) ( )\\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ 1 Turb Turb\\nj j i i j ij ij ij ij ij\\n∂ ∂ + + ∂ + − −\\n∂ ∂ ∂\\nσ σ σ σ u u u uu\\nWherein ˆ\\nu represents the group average fluctuation velocity and ˆ\\nσ the laminar stress\\ncorresponding to the fluctuation velocity after the group average, similar to the calculation\\nσ ˆ Turb\\nσ .

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract boundary conditions from the provided CFD paper excerpts, validate them against OpenFOAM's boundary name list, correct any spelling mistakes, and present the results in a JSON format. The key boundaries to focus on are outlet, inlet, and airfoil, and the fields involved are nuTilda, U, nut, and p.\n\nFirst, I need to look into the paper's section where boundary conditions are mentioned. From the excerpts, on Page 6, Table 1 lists the boundary conditions used in OpenFOAM. The table has entries for Airfoil, Inlet/outlet, and Front and back. The fields are U, p, nuTilda, and nut. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- For the Airfoil boundary, U is set to fixed-value, which seems incorrect because the airfoil should be a no-slip wall. However, the paper mentions \"no-slip adiabatic condition\" for the airfoil. The nut field uses nutLowReWallFunction, which is a valid OpenFOAM boundary type. The p field is zero gradient, which is zeroGradient in OpenFOAM. But wait, the table says 'fixed-value' for U on the airfoil, which might be a mistake. The correct boundary for a no-slip wall would typically use a fixedValue for U but with a value of (0 0 0) for no-slip. However, OpenFOAM has specific wall boundary types. However, the user instructed to only correct spelling and not change the boundary type. The paper says \"no-slip adiabatic\", so maybe U should be fixedValue with (0 0 0), but the table lists U as fixed-value. The user says to validate against the OpenFOAM list. Checking the OpenFOAM list provided, 'noSlip' is a valid boundary type. But the table uses 'fixed-value' for U on airfoil. There's a conflict here. However, the user says not to change the boundary type except for spelling. The paper's table has U as fixed-value for airfoil, which in OpenFOAM is fixedValue. So spelling is correct. Wait, the table says \"fixed-value\" but OpenFOAM uses camelCase, so fixedValue. So the spelling correction would be to change \"fixed-value\" to \"fixedValue\". Similarly, \"freestream\" is correct as per the OpenFOAM list. The front and back boundaries are listed as 'empty' which is valid.\n\nFor Inlet/outlet, the table says U is freestreamVelocity, which is in the OpenFOAM list. p uses freestreamPressure. nuTilda is freestream, and nut is freestream. The 'Inlet/outlet' is a single boundary in the table, but the user wants them split into 'inlet' and 'outlet'. So I need to separate them. However, the paper might have combined them, but according to the problem statement, if there's a slash, split into distinct boundaries. So the Inlet/outlet in the paper's table should be split into 'inlet' and 'outlet' each with their own conditions. Wait, but the table lists Inlet/outlet as a single entry. However, the user's instruction says to split boundaries with a slash into separate entries. Therefore, 'Inlet/outlet' becomes 'inlet' and 'outlet'. But how do their conditions differ? The table shows for Inlet/outlet, U is freestreamVelocity, p is freestreamPressure, etc. But in reality, inlet and outlet would have different conditions. For example, inlet might have fixedValue for U and outlet might have zeroGradient. But the paper's table seems to treat them as the same, which might be a mistake. However, according to the user's instruction, I must split them and list separately. However, the original paper's table might have a typo here. Alternatively, perhaps the front and back are empty, and the inlet and outlet are separate. The paper's computational domain (Figure 1) is a C-grid around the airfoil, so inlet would be the farfield upstream, outlet the downstream, and the front/back as 2D empty boundaries. The table's 'Inlet/outlet' probably refers to the farfield boundaries (inlet and outlet), but the user wants them split. So for 'inlet', U would be freestreamVelocity, p freestreamPressure, etc. For 'outlet', maybe the same? But typically, outlet might have zeroGradient for velocity and fixed pressure. However, the paper's table lists Inlet/outlet as having freestreamPressure for p, which might be a combined condition. Alternatively, perhaps the paper uses a mixed boundary condition. But the user says to split them. Given that, perhaps the inlet and outlet both use freestream conditions. But this is unclear. However, following the user's instruction to split, I'll consider 'inlet' and 'outlet' as separate boundaries. But in the paper's Table 1, the Inlet/outlet uses freestreamVelocity for U and freestreamPressure for p. So for both inlet and outlet, U is freestreamVelocity, p is freestreamPressure. However, this is unconventional. Normally, inlet would have fixedValue for U and outlet might have inletOutlet or zeroGradient. But according to the table, they used 'freestream' which is a valid OpenFOAM boundary. So perhaps the 'inlet' and 'outlet' are both set to freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. But I need to check if 'freestreamVelocity' and 'freestreamPressure' are valid. Yes, according to the OpenFOAM list provided, 'freestreamVelocity' and 'freestreamPressure' are valid. So for inlet and outlet, U is freestreamVelocity, p is freestreamPressure, nuTilda is freestream, and nut is freestream. But the user wants the inlet and outlet split. So the boundaries would be:\n\n- inlet: U=freestreamVelocity, p=freestreamPressure, nuTilda=freestream, nut=freestream\n- outlet: same as inlet? But that's unusual. Alternatively, maybe the outlet uses different conditions. The paper's Table 1 says Inlet/outlet uses freestreamPressure for p. But in OpenFOAM, the outlet might use a fixedValue or zeroGradient. However, the user insists to take the paper's data and only correct spelling. Since the paper's table says Inlet/outlet has p as freestreamPressure, then both inlet and outlet would have p as freestreamPressure. But this may not be correct, but according to the user's instruction, I must not change the boundary type except for spelling. So the split would result in both inlet and outlet having the same conditions as per the table.\n\nAnother thing: the 'Front and back' boundaries in the paper's table are set to 'empty', which is correct for 2D simulations in OpenFOAM. So those are handled as 'empty' type.\n\nNow, for the airfoil boundary (wall), the table lists U as fixed-value, which in OpenFOAM is fixedValue. But since it's a no-slip wall, the correct type might be noSlip. However, the user says not to change the boundary type except for spelling. The paper's table says U is fixed-value (corrected to fixedValue), p is zero gradient (corrected to zeroGradient). The nut uses nutLowReWallFunction, which is valid. nuTilda is fixed-value (fixedValue). But in OpenFOAM, for a wall, nuTilda (from the S-A model) typically uses fixedValue 0. However, the paper's table says fixed-value for nuTilda on the airfoil. So we'll keep that as fixedValue.\n\nPutting this all together, the corrected boundary conditions are:\n\n- airfoil:\n  - U: fixedValue (corrected from fixed-value)\n  - p: zeroGradient (corrected from zero gradient)\n  - nuTilda: fixedValue\n  - nut: nutLowReWallFunction (corrected from nutLowReWallFunction is already correct)\n- inlet:\n  - U: freestreamVelocity\n  - p: freestreamPressure\n  - nuTilda: freestream\n  - nut: freestream\n- outlet:\n  - U: freestreamVelocity\n  - p: freestreamPressure\n  - nuTilda: freestream\n  - nut: freestream\n- front and back (empty), but the user only wants outlet, inlet, airfoil.\n\nWait, the user specified to only include outlet, inlet, and airfoil. So front and back are excluded.\n\nBut the user's question mentions the boundaries to consider are outlet, inlet, and airfoil. So the final JSON should have these three.\n\nNow, checking the OpenFOAM boundary list for each field:\n\n- For U on airfoil: fixedValue is valid.\n- p on airfoil: zeroGradient is valid.\n- nuTilda on airfoil: fixedValue is valid.\n- nut on airfoil: nutLowReWallFunction is valid.\n\nFor inlet and outlet:\n\n- U: freestreamVelocity is valid.\n- p: freestreamPressure is valid.\n- nuTilda: freestream is valid.\n- nut: freestream is valid.\n\nSpelling corrections needed:\n\n- fixed-value → fixedValue\n- zero gradient → zeroGradient\n- Others are correctly spelled.\n\nSo the final JSON would structure each boundary (airfoil, inlet, outlet) with their respective fields and corrected boundary types.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°.

For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want to simulate the NACA0012 airfoil case as described in the paper using OpenFOAM-v2406. The specific conditions are steady-state, Mach 0.15, Re 6e6, 10° angle of attack with the Spalart-Allmaras model on a 897x257 grid. They need the initial and boundary conditions in a specific JSON format based on the provided structure.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the relevant parameters from the paper. The paper mentions Mach number 0.15, Reynolds number 6e6 based on chord length, ambient temperature 300 K. The boundary conditions from Table 1 in the paper align with the JSON structure provided: airfoil uses fixedValue for U, zeroGradient for p, fixedValue for nuTilda, and nutLowReWallFunction for nut. Inlet and outlet use freestreamVelocity for U, freestreamPressure for p, and freestream for nuTilda and nut.\n\nNext, converting the non-dimensional parameters to field values. The Reynolds number Re = 6e6 is based on chord length (c=1m), velocity, and kinematic viscosity. Using Re = (ρ * U * c)/μ, but since OpenFOAM uses kinematic viscosity (ν = μ/ρ), Re = (U * c)/ν. So ν = U * c / Re. But we need to find U and ν.\n\nThe Mach number Ma = U / a, where a is the speed of sound. At 300 K, a = sqrt(γ * R * T). Assuming air, γ=1.4, R=287 J/kg·K. So a = sqrt(1.4 * 287 * 300) ≈ 347.2 m/s. Then U = Ma * a = 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s.\n\nNow, Re = 6e6 = (U * c) / ν → ν = (52.08 * 1) / 6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s. But the paper mentions the S-A model, which uses nuTilda (modified kinematic viscosity). The freestream value for nuTilda in S-A is typically 3 to 5 times ν. Let's use 3 * ν ≈ 2.604e-5 m²/s. The nut (turbulent viscosity) at inlet can be set to a small value, but according to the S-A model, in the freestream, nut should be zero or a negligible value. However, the JSON structure requires a value, so maybe set to 0.\n\nFor pressure, the freestreamPressure is likely the operating pressure. Assuming incompressible, p is kinematic pressure (p/ρ). If the operating pressure is 0 (common in OpenFOAM), then freestreamPressure would be 0. But need to check if the paper specifies. The paper doesn't mention specific pressure values, so defaulting to 0.\n\nThe angle of attack is 10°, so the inlet velocity direction needs to be adjusted. In 2D, Ux = U * cos(10°), Uy = U * sin(10°). So U components are (52.08 * cos(10°), 52.08 * sin(10°), 0). Calculating those: cos(10°) ≈ 0.9848, sin(10°) ≈ 0.1736. So U ≈ (51.3, 9.02, 0) m/s.\n\nPutting it all together, the initial conditions would set U to the freestream velocity, p to 0, nuTilda to 2.604e-5, and nut to 0. The boundary conditions follow the provided JSON structure with these values. The airfoil wall has U as fixedValue (no-slip, so (0 0 0)), p zeroGradient, nuTilda fixedValue 0 (since S-A requires nuTilda=0 at walls), and nut using nutLowReWallFunction which automatically handles the wall treatment.\n\nI need to ensure that all values are correctly converted and that the boundary types match exactly as per the user's JSON structure. Double-checking the Mach number calculation, Reynolds number conversion, and the direction of the velocity vector for the angle of attack. Also confirming that nuTilda's freestream value is correctly derived from the S-A model's requirements. Finally, validate that the JSON structure adheres strictly to the user's specified format without any additional fields or changes.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to simulate the NACA0012 airfoil case using OpenFOAM-v2406 with the Spalart-Allmaras model. They specified the case details, including Mach 0.15, Re 6e6, 10° angle of attack. The necessary files are listed, and they provided initial and boundary conditions in JSON.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure all the required OpenFOAM files are covered. The user mentioned '0/nuTilda', 'system/controlDict', 'constant/turbulenceProperties', and others. Let's go through each file.\n\nStarting with '0/nuTilda'. The initial condition is 2.604e-5, and boundary conditions are specified for airfoil, inlet, outlet. The airfoil uses fixedValue 0, inlet and outlet freestream with the same value. The FoamFile header should have class volScalarField and object nuTilda.\n\nNext, 'system/controlDict'. The application is simpleFoam, correct? The user emphasized that. The startTime is 0, endTime 5000, writeInterval 500. The time format is noAdjust. The stopAt is endTime. Makes sense for a steady-state simulation.\n\nFor 'constant/turbulenceProperties', RASModel is SpalartAllmaras, and RASModel is active. Turbulence is on, printCoeffs enabled.\n\nThe '0/U' file: initial velocity [51.3, 9.02, 0], which corresponds to 10° AoA. The airfoil has fixedValue [0,0,0], inlet and outlet freestreamVelocity. The class is volVectorField.\n\n'0/nut' is a volScalarField. Initial 0, airfoil uses nutLowReWallFunction, inlet/outlet freestream 0. The dimensions are [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0].\n\n'0/p' has initial 0, zeroGradient on airfoil, freestreamPressure on inlet/outlet. Class volScalarField.\n\n'system/fvSchemes' needs the discretization schemes. For steady-state, ddt is steadyState. div terms use Gauss upwind for turbulence, linear for others. laplacian and interpolation as usual.\n\n'system/fvSolution' should have solvers for U, p, nuTilda. SIMPLE algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling. Relaxation factors for U and nuTilda.\n\n'constant/transportProperties' specifies kinematic viscosity. The user mentioned Re 6e6, chord length 1m. nu = (velocity * chord)/Re. Velocity magnitude is sqrt(51.3^2 +9.02^2) ≈ 52 m/s. So nu = 52*1 / 6e6 ≈ 8.67e-6. Wait, but the user provided initial nuTilda as 2.604e-5. Wait, nuTilda is the modified viscosity, but transportProperties has nu. Let me check the Re. Re = rho*U*L/mu. For air, nu = mu/rho. Given Re=6e6, U=52, L=1, nu= (U*L)/Re = 52/6e6 ≈ 8.6667e-6. So in transportProperties, nu should be 8.6667e-6. But the user's initial nuTilda is 2.604e-5. That's 3 times nu, which aligns with Spalart-Allmaras where nuTilda is often initialized to 3*nu. So transportProperties' nu is correct here.\n\nWait, but the user's JSON says initial nuTilda is 2.604e-5. So if nu is 8.67e-6, then 3*nu is ~2.6e-5, which matches. So the transportProperties nu is correctly set to 8.6667e-06.\n\nNow, check each file against the user's boundary conditions. For airfoil, U is fixedValue [0,0,0], p zeroGradient, nuTilda fixedValue 0, nut nutLowReWallFunction. Inlet and outlet have freestreamVelocity, freestreamPressure, etc. The user mentioned that for waveTransmissive, set lInf=1, but that's not needed here as boundaries are freestream.\n\nMake sure all the files are structured correctly. The keys in the JSON are the filenames, and the values are the file contents as strings. Each FoamFile header is included without the OpenFOAM comment block but with the necessary version, format, class, object.\n\nDouble-check the application entry in controlDict is simpleFoam. The turbulenceProperties has RASModel SpalartAllmaras. The fvSchemes and fvSolution are set up for a steady-state RANS simulation with SIMPLE algorithm.\n\nAlso, ensure that the initial conditions in the '0' directory files match the JSON provided. U starts at [51.3, 9.02, 0], p at 0, nuTilda at 2.604e-5, nut at 0. All boundary conditions are correctly applied as per the user's JSON.\n\nFinally, validate that all files are included as per the user's list: 0/nuTilda, 0/U, 0/p, 0/nut, system/controlDict, system/fvSchemes, system/fvSolution, constant/turbulenceProperties, constant/transportProperties. No extra files, and all necessary ones are present.\n",

So the problem is that in the '0/p' file, the 'dimensions' keyword is missing. OpenFOAM requires each field to have a dimensions entry specifying its units.\n\nLooking at the provided case files, let's check the '0/p' entry. The user provided the content of '0/p', and I see that after the FoamFile header, the internalField is set, but there's no 'dimensions' line. Comparing this to other files like '0/nut' or '0/U', those do have the dimensions defined. For example, '0/nut' has \"dimensions [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0];\". The 'p' file is missing this line.\n\nThe pressure field in OpenFOAM must have the correct dimensions. Without the dimensions keyword, OpenFOAM can't parse the field, leading to this fatal error. So the fix is to add the dimensions entry to the '0/p' file. The correct dimensions for pressure in OpenFOAM are [1 -1 -2 0 0 0 0], which corresponds to kg/(m·s²) or Pascals.\n\nTherefore, the 'wrong_file' is '0/p', and the advice is to add the dimensions line right after the FoamFile block but before the internalField.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error because the 'dimensions' keyword is undefined in the p file. The error message points to lines 9-33 in the 0/p dictionary.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided 0/p file contents. Looking at the file, the FoamFile header is there with version, format, class, and object. But after that, the internalField and boundaryField are defined without a dimensions entry. OpenFOAM requires the dimensions keyword for field files to specify the units of the field. The sample files from the tutorials all include the dimensions line. So, the root cause is the missing dimensions in the p file.\n\nThe user's initial and boundary conditions from the paper must be maintained. The initial p is 0, and the boundary conditions for airfoil, inlet, outlet, front, and back are set as zeroGradient, freestreamPressure, etc. Adding the dimensions shouldn't affect these values as long as the units are consistent.\n\nLooking at the tutorial examples, sample_file_3, 8, and 4 all have dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0] for pressure. That corresponds to kinematic pressure (m²/s²) since OpenFOAM often uses kinematic pressure in incompressible solvers. The user's p file uses uniform 0, which is correct if the dimensions are kinematic.\n\nSo, the fix is to add the dimensions line right after the FoamFile block but before internalField. The correct dimensions for kinematic pressure are [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0]. This addition will resolve the missing keyword error. Also, ensure there are no syntax errors like missing semicolons or brackets. The rest of the file (boundary conditions) is already as per the paper's requirements and doesn't need changes. Testing the modified file should fix the error without altering the initial or boundary conditions.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, the user is getting a FOAM FATAL IO ERROR because the 'dimensions' keyword is missing in their 0/U file. The error message points to line 9 to 34 in the U file. Let me check the provided file contents.\n\nLooking at the user's 0/U file, I see the FoamFile header with version, format, class, and object. The internalField and boundaryField are set up correctly with the specified initial and boundary conditions from the paper. But there's no 'dimensions' entry after the FoamFile block, which is required by OpenFOAM for field files.\n\nIn the sample files from the tutorials, each U file includes a 'dimensions' line right after the FoamFile block. For example, sample_file_15 has 'dimensions [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0];' which corresponds to velocity (length/time). The user's U file is missing this line, causing the error.\n\nThe solution is to add the correct dimensions for velocity. The dimensions for velocity in OpenFOAM are typically [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0], representing meters per second. The user needs to insert this line after the FoamFile block but before the internalField definition. They must ensure the syntax is correct, with square brackets and semicolon.\n\nI should check if adding this line affects the initial or boundary conditions. The paper specifies the initial U as [51.3, 9.02, 0], and the boundary conditions for airfoil, inlet, and outlet. Adding the dimensions line doesn't change these values; it just provides the necessary unit information. So the correction is safe and doesn't violate the requirements.\n\nThe user should modify their 0/U file by inserting 'dimensions [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0];' after the FoamFile block. They need to make sure there are no typos and that the line is properly formatted. Then, rerunning the case should resolve the error.\n",

Let me look at it. The FoamFile header seems okay, class is volScalarField, object is nuTilda. But right after that, the internalField is defined, but there's no 'dimensions' line. The other files like 0/U, 0/p, and 0/nut all have the dimensions specified. For example, in 0/U, after the FoamFile block, there's a dimensions line. But in 0/nuTilda, that line is missing. That's definitely the issue here.\n\nSo the fix is to add the dimensions keyword to the 0/nuTilda file. The correct dimensions for nuTilda in the Spalart-Allmaras model. Since nuTilda is the modified kinematic viscosity, its dimensions should be the same as kinematic viscosity, which is [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0]. Let me verify that. Yes, kinematic viscosity (nu) has dimensions of length squared per time, so [0 2 -1 ...]. The transportProperties file has nu with [0 2 -1 ...], and nuTilda should match that. So adding dimensions [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0]; to the nuTilda file right after the FoamFile block but before internalField.\n\nTherefore, the wrong file is 0/nuTilda, and the advice is to add the missing dimensions entry with the correct values.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me look at these error messages. All three errors are from OpenFOAM, right? The first error is about the keyword 'dimensions' being undefined in the nuTilda file. The second one is the same issue but in the U file, and the third in the p file. Each error is in a different dictionary file: nuTilda, U, and p. The error message structure is identical each time, just the file name changes. So the problem is that the 'dimensions' keyword is missing in all three of these files.\n\nThe user is asking if the error has occurred three times repetitively. Even though each error is in a different file, the same type of error (missing 'dimensions') has happened three separate times. Since they all share the same root cause but in different files, does that count as repetitive? The question is whether the same error has shown up three times. Since each instance is a different file but the same error type, maybe it's considered repetitive. So the answer would be 'yes' because the same error (missing dimensions) is repeated across three files.\n",

Hmm, wallDist is a keyword that's probably required by a specific turbulence model or scheme.\n\nLooking at the case files, especially turbulenceProperties, they're using the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) model. The SA model typically requires the wall distance field, which is computed by the wallDist utility. But in the fvSchemes file, there's no mention of wallDist in the schemes. \n\nIn OpenFOAM, when using certain turbulence models that need wall distance, the fvSchemes must have a section for wallDist to specify the scheme for calculating distance to the wall. The error is because the wallDist entry is missing in fvSchemes. \n\nSo the wrong file is system/fvSchemes. The fix would be adding the wallDist entry there. The steps would be to add a wallDist section with the correct scheme, like Poisson. That's the standard approach for Spalart-Allmaras.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error because the keyword 'wallDist' is undefined in their fvSchemes file. The error message points to lines 11 to 39 in the system/fvSchemes dictionary. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why 'wallDist' is required. From the error and the provided context, it's likely that the simulation is using a turbulence model or something else that requires wall distance calculation. OpenFOAM's wallDist method computes the distance to the nearest wall, which is essential for certain boundary conditions or models, like wall functions in RANS simulations.\n\nLooking at the user's fvSchemes content, there's no 'wallDist' section. Comparing it to the sample files from the tutorials, especially sample_file_16 and sample_file_1, both include a 'wallDist' block with 'method meshWave;'. The user's current file is missing this, which explains the error.\n\nThe solution is to add the 'wallDist' entry. The correct method is usually 'meshWave' as per the samples. I should check if adding this would affect the initial or boundary conditions. The user mentioned not altering those. Since 'wallDist' is a numerical scheme, adding it shouldn't violate any initial or boundary conditions. The turbulence model (probably Spalart-Allmaras based on 'nuTilda') requires this for wall distance computation.\n\nSo, the step-by-step fix would be to edit the fvSchemes file, insert the 'wallDist' section with 'method meshWave;', and ensure the rest of the schemes remain as they are. The user's divSchemes for nuTilda uses 'Gauss upwind', but the sample uses 'bounded Gauss linearUpwind'. However, the user's instructions say not to alter existing schemes unless necessary. Since the error is solely about 'wallDist', modifying other parts isn't needed. Just adding the missing 'wallDist' block should resolve the error without affecting the setup.\n",

For example, adding smoother symGaussSeidel; or another appropriate smoother. Also, maybe check if other necessary parameters for GAMG are present, like preconditioner or tolerance settings.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this OpenFOAM error. The user is getting a fatal IO error because the keyword 'smoother' is undefined in the 'p' solver section of their fvSolution file. The error message points to lines 20-22 in the 'p' solver dictionary.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided fvSolution content. The 'p' solver is using GAMG. In OpenFOAM, when using GAMG, certain parameters like 'smoother' are required. The user's current 'p' solver setup doesn't have a 'smoother' entry, which is causing the error. \n\nLooking at the tutorial examples they provided, like sample_file_14 and sample_file_8, when GAMG is used, the 'smoother' is specified. For instance, sample_file_14 uses 'smoother GaussSeidel;' under the 'p' solver. So the fix here is to add the 'smoother' keyword to the 'p' solver in their fvSolution.\n\nThe user also mentioned that they must not alter initial or boundary conditions. Adding 'smoother' to the 'p' solver's GAMG settings doesn't affect those conditions. The other solvers like 'U' and 'nuTilda' use smoothSolver with symGaussSeidel, which is okay. \n\nSo the step-by-step fix would be to edit the 'p' solver block in system/fvSolution by adding a 'smoother' entry. A common choice for GAMG is 'GaussSeidel' or 'DICGaussSeidel'. Based on the tutorials, 'GaussSeidel' is used in similar contexts. Therefore, adding 'smoother GaussSeidel;' under the 'p' solver's entries should resolve the error. \n\nI should check if any other parameters are missing. The tolerance and relTol are already present. There's no need to change the relaxation factors or other parts of the file. This addition strictly addresses the missing required parameter for GAMG, thus fixing the error without violating any initial or boundary conditions.\n",

The file header and other sections should not be modified in any way.\n\nHere is my response:\nFoamFile\n{\n    version     2.0;\n    format      ascii;\n    class       dictionary;\n    object      fvSolution;\n}\n\nsolvers\n{\n    U\n    {\n        solver          smoothSolver;\n        smoother        symGaussSeidel;\n        tolerance       1e-08;\n        relTol          0.01;\n    }\n    p\n    {\n        solver          GAMG;\n        smoother        GaussSeidel;\n        tolerance       1e-08;\n        relTol          0.01;\n    }\n    nuTilda\n    {\n        solver          smoothSolver;\n        smoother        symGaussSeidel;\n        tolerance       1e-08;\n        relTol          0.1;\n    }\n}\n\nSIMPLE\n{\n    nNonOrthogonalCorrectors 0;\n    consistent      yes;\n    residualControl\n    {\n        U               1e-6;\n        p               1e-6;\n        nuTilda         1e-6;\n    }\n}\n\nrelaxationFactors\n{\n    U               0.3;\n    nuTilda         0.3;\n}",
