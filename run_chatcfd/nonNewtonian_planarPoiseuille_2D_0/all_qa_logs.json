    "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to convert this JSON into Markdown following the user's instructions. Let me read the requirements again carefully. \n\nFirst, each top-level key becomes a main heading with #. The JSON has \"Case_1\" as the top key, so that's the main heading. \n\nThen, the key-value pairs under Case_1 should be unordered list items. So each of those keys like case_name, solver, etc., should be list items with their values. I need to make sure the hierarchy is maintained. Since the JSON structure is two levels deep (Case_1 has child keys), I'll list each child as a bullet point.\n\nLet me check the example again. The user provided a sample JSON and wants the output in Markdown. The example's JSON has Case_1 as the main key, and several sub-keys. So the Markdown should start with # Case_1, then a list of each subkey as an item, using hyphens and colons.\n\nWait, how exactly to format each key-value? Maybe like \"- **key**: value\". So bold the key, followed by the value. That's a common Markdown way to present key-value pairs in a list.\n\nLet me test with the case_name. The key is case_name and value is \"nonNewtonian_planarPoiseuille_2D\". So in Markdown: \"- **case_name**: nonNewtonian_planarPoiseuille_2D\". That makes sense.\n\nAll other entries under Case_1 need to be converted similarly. The case_specific_description has a longer value, but it's still a single line. Just include it as is after the colon. \n\nI should ensure there's no nesting beyond the main heading and the list items. Since all the data is under Case_1 and its direct children, there's no deeper hierarchy. So each key-value pair is a top-level list item under the main heading.\n\nOkay, putting it all together. Start with # Case_1, then each subkey as a list item with bold key and the value. That should meet all three requirements. Let me draft it to check.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Alright, I need to convert the given JSON into Markdown according to the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding the requirements again. The top-level keys in the JSON should be main headings (using #). Each key-value pair under them should be unordered list items, and the hierarchy should be maintained.\n\nLooking at the JSON provided, there's a top-level key \"Case_1\". That should become a main heading. Then, inside \"Case_1\", there are several keys like \"case_name\", \"solver\", etc. Each of these should be bullet points under the main heading.\n\nWait, the user mentioned to maintain the original key-value hierarchy in list format. Since all the sub-keys are under \"Case_1\", which is a single top-level key, the structure will be straightforward. For each sub-key, I'll list the key followed by its value as a list item. I'll check if there are any nested structures, but in this case, all the values are strings, so no further nesting is needed.\n\nLet me start formatting. The main heading is \"Case_1\" with a #. Then each subsequent key-value pair is a list item starting with a hyphen. The keys should be in bold perhaps? Or just plain text? The example the user provided in the answer uses bold for the keys. Let me confirm that. Yes, in the example answer, keys like **case_name** are bolded followed by their values. So I need to use **key**: value.\n\nSo for example:\n- **case_name**: nonNewtonian_planarPoiseuille_2D\n\nThat's how each entry should look. Let me make sure there are no other hierarchies. The JSON doesn't have nested objects beyond the first level under \"Case_1\", so each key there is a direct child. Therefore, all list items are at the same level. The case_specific_description is a longer string, but still a single value. No need for sub-lists there.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The main heading is # Case_1, followed by each key as a list item. Let me write that out step by step to ensure I don't miss any keys. There are five key-value pairs under Case_1: case_name, solver, turbulence_model, other_physical_model, case_specific_description. All should be included.\n\nAlso, need to check the formatting for any special characters, like underscores which are in some values. In Markdown, underscores can be used for italics, but since they are part of the value, they should be left as-is. The example answer shows them unescaped, so that's acceptable.\n\nNo other formatting issues come to mind. Let me reconstruct the Markdown as per the example. It should look exactly like the user's example answer. Let me verify once again:\n\n- Top-level key as # heading.\n- Each sub-key as a bullet point with the key in bold and the value after a colon.\n- Values are plain text.\n\nYes, that's correct. The user's example uses hyphens and bold text for keys. All right, I can proceed to write the final Markdown accordingly.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Alright, let me tackle this query. The user wants me to extract boundary conditions from a CFD paper excerpt, validate them against OpenFOAM's boundary types, and present them in a JSON format. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided excerpts. The paper mentions a 2D laminar simulation of planar Poiseuille flow using pimpleFoam with a Maxwell model. The fluid is initially at rest, with a constant pressure gradient applied from time zero. The initial relative pressure is 0, and the wall velocity is also 0.\n\nThe key here is the boundary conditions for the fields p, sigma, and U. Since it's a planar Poiseuille flow, typically this involves two walls with no-slip conditions for velocity and possibly fixed pressure gradients at the inlet and outlet. But the excerpt doesn't explicitly state the BCs, so I might have to infer based on standard setups for such flows.\n\nIn planar Poiseuille flow, the flow is between two parallel plates. The usual setup is no-slip (zero velocity) at the walls (top and bottom in 2D), and periodic or fixedValue for the inlet/outlet. However, since this is a pressure-driven flow, perhaps the inlet and outlet have fixed pressure gradients. But the exact BCs aren't mentioned in the excerpts provided. Wait, the user says the paper mentions the boundaries, but I need to check the excerpts again.\n\nLooking back at the excerpts: \"The velocity of wall at the initial moment is 0.\" So the walls have velocity 0, which implies no-slip BC for U (velocity). For pressure, the walls might have zero gradient (zeroGradient) because the flow is driven by a pressure gradient applied from the start. However, in some cases, walls can have fixedValue for pressure, but in incompressible flows, typically the pressure BCs are zeroGradient for walls. \n\nWait, the pressure gradient is constant and applied from time zero. The initial internal pressure field is 0. So perhaps the inlet and outlet are the ones with pressure BCs. But since it's a planar Poiseuille flow, maybe the simulation uses periodic boundaries, but that's not specified here. Alternatively, the inlet and outlet could be set with fixedValue for pressure, creating the gradient. However, without explicit mention in the excerpts, maybe the walls are just the top and bottom with no-slip, and the front and back (inlet/outlet) might have a different BC. However, the excerpt doesn't mention inlet/outlet, only walls. Hmm.\n\nThe user is asking to extract BCs from the given excerpts. The excerpts mention \"the velocity of wall at the initial moment is 0.\" So the walls have U set to 0, which is a fixedValue of [0 0 0] in 2D. For the pressure (p) at the walls, since it's incompressible and the walls are stationary, the typical BC is zeroGradient. The sigma field (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) is given as 0, but sigma in this context might be a stress or another parameter; but the user wants BCs for sigma. Since sigma is a constant here (0), maybe it's set to fixedValue 0 on walls. But the user said to look for boundary types in the paper, possibly misspelled. But the excerpts don't explicitly mention BC types, so I need to infer based on standard BCs for this setup.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of OpenFOAM boundary names to validate against. So I need to check if the BCs inferred are in that list. For example, walls with U=0 would be noSlip or fixedValue. But noSlip is a type in OpenFOAM, which sets U to zero. So for velocity (U) on walls, the BC is noSlip. For pressure (p), walls typically have zeroGradient. The sigma field's BC isn't mentioned, but the stefan-boltzmann constant is given as 0, so maybe fixedValue 0 on walls. However, sigma might be a scalar field here; if sigma is part of the Maxwell model, perhaps it's a stress term. Alternatively, if sigma is a radiation parameter, but the problem is non-Newtonian using Maxwell model, so radiation might not be involved. The paper mentions stefan-boltzmann constant is 0, which is unusual for a non-Newtonian flow. Maybe that's a typo or a different parameter. But the user wants sigma's BC. Assuming sigma is a field with BCs, but the excerpts mention it's a constant, so perhaps fixedValue 0 on all boundaries. Alternatively, if sigma isn't a field but a model parameter, then maybe no BCs are needed. But the user specifically asked for BCs for fields p, sigma, U. So sigma must be a field here.\n\nPutting it all together, the walls (top and bottom in 2D) have U as noSlip, p as zeroGradient, and sigma as fixedValue 0. If there are inlet/outlet boundaries, they might have different BCs, but the excerpts don't mention them. Given that the flow is pressure-driven, maybe the inlet and outlet are cyclic or periodic, but that's not stated. However, the user mentions to only include the boundaries specified in the paper. The excerpts only explicitly mention the wall. So the BCs would be:\n\nFor walls:\n- U: noSlip\n- p: zeroGradient\n- sigma: fixedValue 0\n\nOther boundaries (like inlet/outlet) aren't mentioned, so perhaps they aren't part of the problem. The user might have missed them, but according to the given data, we only have walls.\n\nNeed to check against OpenFOAM's boundary types. The user insists on correcting only spelling mistakes. Since in the excerpts, the walls are mentioned, and the BC types are inferred as noSlip for U, which is in the provided list. zeroGradient is also in the list. fixedValue is present as well. For sigma, fixedValue is correct. So the JSON would have boundaries named 'wall' for each field with corrected types.\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to simulate a 2D laminar incompressible planar Poiseuille flow of a non-Newtonian fluid using OpenFOAM-v2406, specifically the pimpleFoam solver. The Maxwell viscoelastic model is used, with the simulation starting from rest (initial velocity and relative pressure are zero). A constant pressure gradient is applied from time zero, and there's no radiative heat transfer since sigma (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) is set to zero.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the necessary parameters and set up the initial and boundary conditions based on the provided JSON structure. The given boundary conditions list specifies fields 'p', 'sigma', and 'U' with their respective boundary types. The user emphasized not changing any boundary types, so I must adhere strictly to that.\n\nLooking at the paper excerpts:\n- Initial relative pressure is 0, so internalField for 'p' is 0.\n- Initial velocity is 0, so 'U' internalField is (0 0 0).\n- Walls have no-slip for velocity ('noSlip' type for 'U'), which matches the JSON structure.\n- For 'sigma', the boundaries are 'fixedValue' on walls. But since sigma is given as 0, does this mean the initial field or the boundary value? The paper mentions Stefan-Boltzmann constant is 0, which probably relates to radiation, but in the context of Maxwell model, 'sigma' might refer to the viscoelastic stress. Need to clarify. However, the user provided that sigma's boundary is fixedValue. Given that the problem states sigma=0 (probably indicating no radiation or a model parameter), the initial and boundary values for 'sigma' field would be 0.\n\nThe pressure gradient is applied as a constant from t=0. In OpenFOAM, pressure gradient can be imposed through boundary conditions or via a source term. Since the user's JSON structure specifies 'zeroGradient' for 'p' on walls, the pressure gradient might be implemented through a modified pressure setup, perhaps using a fixedValue on inlet/outlet. But the user hasn't included inlet/outlet boundaries in the example. The provided JSON only includes 'wall' boundaries. This is a bit confusing because planar Poiseuille flow typically has inlet and outlet, but maybe the setup is periodic or uses a channel flow with walls on top and bottom. Assuming the domain is a channel with walls at top and bottom (y-direction), and periodic in flow direction (x), the pressure gradient might be handled through a momentum source term instead of boundary conditions. However, the user didn't mention periodic boundaries, so perhaps the inlet and outlet are included but not in the provided boundary list. Since the user's JSON structure only includes 'wall' boundaries, maybe the case is set up with walls on top and bottom, and the pressure gradient is applied via the initial conditions or through a source term. But in OpenFOAM, for pimpleFoam, pressure gradient can be part of the solution. However, the user wants the initial and boundary conditions. The initial 'p' is 0, and walls have zeroGradient, which would imply that the pressure gradient is enforced through other means, possibly a body force in fvOptions.\n\nRegarding the non-Newtonian model (Maxwell), the parameters like relaxation time and viscosity would be part of the physical model setup in transportProperties, not directly the initial/boundary conditions, so they might not affect the fields here.\n\nThe flow parameters: since it's planar Poiseuille flow, the Reynolds number might be involved, but the user hasn't provided dimensional parameters. However, the question mentions converting non-dimensional parameters to field values. But if the paper doesn't specify Re or others, maybe the user expects assuming some parameters or that the initial/boundary conditions are sufficient as per the given data. Given that the user provided the JSON structure and asks to strictly follow it, I should map the given info into the JSON format.\n\nSo, initial conditions:\n- 'p' internalField: 0\n- 'U' internalField: (0 0 0)\n- 'sigma' (assuming it's the viscoelastic stress tensor) internalField: maybe a tensor with zeros, but the paper says \"stefan-boltzman constant(sigma) is 0\", which might be a typo. Since Stefan-Boltzmann constant is radiation-related, but the user's case mentions no radiative heat transfer, perhaps 'sigma' here is a scalar field set to 0. But the Maxwell model typically involves a stress tensor. This is confusing. Alternatively, 'sigma' in the JSON refers to a different field. However, the user's instruction says to follow the provided boundary conditions list, where 'sigma' has boundaries as fixedValue. Given that the paper states sigma=0, the initial value would be 0, and boundary conditions for 'sigma' on walls are fixedValue 0.\n\nWait, but the JSON structure has for 'sigma' field, boundaries of type 'fixedValue'. The paper says Stefan-Boltzmann sigma is 0. But perhaps this is a different sigma. Since the problem mentions using the Maxwell model, which involves a relaxation time and possibly a polymeric stress field. Maybe the 'sigma' in the JSON is the viscoelastic stress tensor. However, OpenFOAM typically uses 'sigma' for the stress tensor in viscoelastic models. The initial value would be zero since the fluid is initially at rest. The boundary condition for 'sigma' on walls would be fixedValue as zero tensor, but the JSON specifies 'fixedValue' type. So, in the initial field, 'sigma' (if it's a tensor) would be a uniform tensor of zeros. However, if 'sigma' is a scalar (like in radiation), then initial is 0. But based on the Maxwell model, the stress is tensorial. However, the provided JSON refers to 'sigma' as a field with boundaries on 'wall' as fixedValue. Since the user didn't specify tensor fields, but the problem mentions the Maxwell model, perhaps 'sigma' is the polymeric stress tensor, and initial is zero.\n\nTherefore, mapping this into the JSON:\n\nInitial conditions for 'p' is 0 (scalar), 'U' is (0 0 0) (vector), 'sigma' is 0 (if scalar) or a tensor with zeros. But according to the user's JSON, fields are 'p', 'sigma', 'U'. Assuming 'sigma' is a scalar (maybe a model parameter), but in Maxwell model, the stress is a tensor. However, the user's JSON might have 'sigma' as a scalar field related to another parameter. Since the paper mentions stefan-boltzman constant is 0, which is a scalar, perhaps 'sigma' here is that constant, set to 0. Then initial 'sigma' is 0, and boundaries for 'sigma' (walls) are fixedValue 0. But this is a constant, not a field, unless it's a field in the case. Maybe the user has a field named 'sigma' for some radiation parameter, which is disabled by setting it to 0. In that case, initial 'sigma' is 0, and on walls it's fixedValue 0.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON response should have:\n\nInitial conditions:\n- p: 0\n- U: [0, 0, 0]\n- sigma: 0\n\nBoundary conditions for each field as per the given structure, with the values set according to the problem description. For 'p', walls have zeroGradient. Since initial pressure is 0 and zeroGradient, the pressure gradient would be applied through other means (like a source term). For 'sigma', walls are fixedValue 0, matching the problem's sigma=0. For 'U', walls are noSlip, which corresponds to velocity [0,0,0].\n\nTherefore, the final JSON should look like this:\n",

    "reasoning_content": "Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to set up a 2D laminar simulation of planar Poiseuille flow for a non-Newtonian Maxwell fluid using pimpleFoam in OpenFOAM v2406. They provided specific initial and boundary conditions, and they need the necessary case files. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the required files based on the list they provided. The files are in system/, constant/, and 0/ directories. Let's start with the system files.\n\nFor system/controlDict: The application must be pimpleFoam. They mentioned starting from rest, so startTime is 0. The endTime and deltaT need to be set, maybe 1 second with a time step of 0.001. WriteControl and writeInterval are important for output. Also, since it's 2D, I should include the 2D runtime option in the functions to scale the domain.\n\nNext, system/fvSchemes: Since it's a transient incompressible flow, the ddt scheme should be Euler. grad and div terms for velocity and pressure need appropriate schemes, like Gauss linear. For laplacian, Gauss linear corrected might be suitable for non-Newtonian fluids. Interpolation and snGrad schemes should be set to linear.\n\nsystem/fvSolution: PIMPLE settings with correct number of outer and inner iterations. Relaxation factors for pressure and velocity. Solvers for p, U, and possibly sigma. Since sigma is part of the Maxwell model, it needs a solver, maybe smoothSolver with symGaussSeidel.\n\nsystem/decomposeParDict: They mentioned not needing the mesh, so decomposition might not be crucial, but set to hierarchical with simpleCoeffs for 1 sub-domain as default.\n\nsystem/probes and system/singleGraph: Not specified in the query, but since they're listed, maybe empty entries or default setups.\n\nNow, constant files: transportProperties. The Maxwell model requires parameters like nu (kinematic viscosity), rho (density), and maybe the relaxation time. Since the user mentioned the Maxwell viscoelastic model, but OpenFOAM's built-in models might need specific entries. However, the user didn't mention specific parameters, so I'll set placeholder values with comments.\n\nconstant/turbulenceProperties: Since it's laminar, simulationType to laminar.\n\nconstant/fvOptions: No fvOptions specified, so empty entries.\n\nFor the 0/ files: p, U, and sigma. Initial conditions are zero for p, U (0 0 0), and sigma 0. Boundary conditions for walls: zeroGradient for p, no-slip (fixedValue 0 0 0) for U, and fixedValue 0 for sigma. Need to make sure all boundaries are covered, but in a 2D planar flow, there might be inlet and outlet as patches. Wait, the user specified boundaries as 'wall' for all fields. Wait, looking back at the JSON boundary conditions: for p, the boundaries named \"wall\" have zeroGradient. Similarly for U and sigma. But in planar Poiseuille flow, typically there are two walls (top and bottom) and possibly periodic boundaries or inlet/outlet. However, the user's JSON specifies all boundaries as 'wall' which might be a simplification. So in the 0 files, all patches (walls) are set with the given BCs.\n\nFor the fields in 0/, each must have dimensions, internalField, and boundaryFields. For U, dimensions [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0], internalField uniform (0 0 0), and each wall patch (assuming patches are named like \"topWall\", \"bottomWall\") set to noSlip. But the user's JSON says boundaries named \"wall\" with no-slip. So in the 0/U file, all wall patches (maybe named wall) are set to type fixedValue with value (0 0 0). Wait, the user specified \"noSlip\" type, but in OpenFOAM, noSlip is an alias for fixedValue with a zero vector. So setting type noSlip is acceptable, and it would set the velocity to zero.\n\nSimilarly, sigma's boundary is fixedValue 0 on walls. For p, zeroGradient on walls.\n\nWait, but in planar Poiseuille flow with a pressure gradient, usually the inlet and outlet might have fixedPressure or something else. But the user's setup has a constant pressure gradient applied from time zero. So perhaps the domain is periodic in the flow direction, and the pressure gradient is applied via a source term. Alternatively, the pressure gradient is imposed through the fvOptions. However, the user didn't mention fvOptions for pressure gradient. Maybe the Maxwell model handles the pressure gradient as part of the stress. This is unclear. But according to the user's initial setup, the pressure gradient is applied from time zero. So maybe the solver includes a momentum source. Alternatively, the pressure initial condition is zero, and the gradient is applied via boundary conditions. But in the boundary conditions provided, the p field has zeroGradient on walls. If the flow is driven by a pressure gradient, perhaps the inlet and outlet are not walls. But the user's boundary conditions only mention \"wall\" boundaries. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, the user's case is planar Poiseuille flow. In such a case, the flow is between two infinite plates, so 2D with periodic boundary conditions in the flow direction. So in OpenFOAM, this would be set up with periodic patches. However, the user's provided boundary conditions in the JSON only mention walls. Maybe the user has set up the mesh with walls and inlet/outlet as other patches, but the JSON only specifies the walls. Alternatively, the problem is using a pressure-driven flow with fixedGradient for p on certain patches. But according to the initial conditions, the pressure gradient is applied from time zero, which might be through a momentum source term. But the user didn't mention using fvOptions for this. \n\nAlternatively, the pressure gradient could be imposed via the initial conditions, but the initial pressure is zero. However, a constant pressure gradient in the flow direction can be represented using a momentum source. But the user's JSON doesn't mention this. Given that the user's setup says a constant pressure gradient is applied from time zero, but no specific boundary conditions for inlet/outlet, perhaps the domain is periodic, and the pressure gradient is added as a source term in the momentum equation. However, the user didn't specify that. This might be a point of confusion. However, since the user's boundary conditions only mention walls, perhaps the actual setup uses walls and the pressure gradient is handled through another means. But the user's instruction is to follow the JSON strictly, so we must set all boundaries as specified. \n\nSo, in the 0/p file, the boundary conditions for all walls (patches named wall) are zeroGradient. The initial pressure is zero. The pressure gradient is part of the applied constant gradient, but in OpenFOAM, this might be handled via a fixedGradient for p on certain patches. Wait, maybe the user is using a body force to impose the pressure gradient. For incompressible flow, the pressure gradient can be represented as a source term. But this isn't specified in the setup. The user mentioned \"constant pressure gradient applied from time zero\", so maybe in the simulation, the gradient is imposed via the fvSchemes or through an explicit source. However, the user's provided files don't mention this. This could be an oversight, but the user's request is to follow their boundary conditions as per the JSON. So, I'll proceed with the given BCs, even if it's not physically accurate, as per the user's instructions.\n\nProceeding, in the 0/U file, walls have no-slip (fixedValue (0 0 0)). The initial velocity is zero. The pressure initial field is zero, and the sigma (maybe stress?) is also zero. The sigma field has walls with fixedValue 0. \n\nAnother thing to note: the Maxwell model requires the specification of the viscoelastic parameters. In the transportProperties, we need to define the model. In OpenFOAM, the Maxwell model might be part of the viscoelastic model, so in constant/transportProperties, we need to set the model to Maxwell, and specify parameters like relaxation time lambda and viscosity. For example:\n\ntransportModel  Maxwell;\nrho             [1 -3 0 0 0 0 0] 1000;\nnu              [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 0.01;\nlambda          [0 0 1 0 0 0 0] 0.1;\n\nBut the user's excerpt mentions \"Maxwell viscoelastic laminar stress model\", so perhaps the model is selected in turbulenceProperties, but since it's laminar, maybe the turbulenceProperties is set to laminar, and the viscoelastic model is specified elsewhere. Wait, OpenFOAM's standard solvers for viscoelastic fluids may use a different approach. The user is using pimpleFoam, which is a transient solver for incompressible flows. To incorporate viscoelasticity, they might need a modified solver or use a stress transport model. However, the user specified that the other_physical_model is set to Maxwell. In OpenFOAM, this might involve selecting the stress model in constant/rheologyProperties or a similar file. But the user's listed files don't include that. Hmm. Wait, looking at the files the user wants: constant/transportProperties, turbulenceProperties, fvOptions. \n\nSince the user is using a Maxwell model, the transportProperties should define the necessary parameters. So in transportProperties, we need to set the model to Maxwell and provide the relevant parameters like relaxation time and viscosity. For example:\n\ntransportModel  Maxwell;\nnu              [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 0.01;\nlambda          [0 0 1 0 0 0 0] 0.1;\nrho             [1 -3 0 0 0 0 0] 1000;\n\nBut the user didn't specify these values, so placeholders can be used.\n\nAdditionally, in constant/turbulenceProperties, since it's laminar, simulationType laminar; RAS { RASModel laminar; turbulence off; printCoeffs off; }\n\nFor the 0/sigma file: Sigma might represent the viscoelastic stress tensor. In OpenFOAM, the Maxwell model might use a sigma field with appropriate dimensions. The dimensions for sigma would depend on whether it's a stress (units of Pa) or a tensor. Assuming sigma is the viscoelastic stress tensor, dimensions would be [1 -1 -2 0 0 0 0] (kg/m/s² = Pa). But in the initial conditions, it's set to 0, which matches the JSON.\n\nPutting this all together, each file's content needs to be structured with FoamFile headers and the respective entries. Make sure that all files are correctly formatted without the OpenFOAM header comments but with FoamFile entries.\n\nLet me check each file systematically:\n\n1. system/controlDict:\n   - application: pimpleFoam\n   - startTime 0\n   - endTime 1 (arbitrary, user can adjust)\n   - deltaT 0.001\n   - writeControl timeStep\n   - writeInterval 500\n   - functions for 2D scaling (using the #includeFunc flowRatePatch to scale the mesh if necessary, but perhaps a simpler approach with the transform function in controlDict to apply 2D scaling, setting the third component to 0.1m and scale false)\n\n2. system/fvSchemes:\n   - ddt Euler\n   - grad schemes Gauss linear\n   - div(phi,U) Gauss linearUpwind grad(U)\n   - div(phi,sigma) Gauss linear\n   - laplacian schemes Gauss linear corrected\n   - interpolationSchemes linear\n   - snGradSchemes corrected\n\n3. system/fvSolution:\n   - PIMPLE: corrector steps, residual controls for U, p, sigma\n   - relaxation factors\n   - solver settings for each equation\n\n4. system/decomposeParDict:\n   - method simple, 1 subdomain\n\n5. 0/p:\n   - dimensions [0 2 -2 0 0 0 0] (pressure divided by density)\n   - internalField uniform 0\n   - boundaryField: wall { type zeroGradient; }\n\n6. 0/U:\n   - dimensions [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0]\n   - internalField uniform (0 0 0)\n   - boundaryField: wall { type noSlip; }\n\n7. 0/sigma:\n   - Depending on the model, dimensions might be [1 -1 -2 0 0 0 0] (stress)\n   - internalField uniform 0\n   - boundaryField: wall { type fixedValue; value uniform 0; }\n\n8. constant/transportProperties:\n   - Maxwell model parameters: nu, lambda, rho\n\n9. constant/turbulenceProperties:\n   - simulationType laminar\n\n10. constant/fvOptions: empty\n\nAlso, check that the solver for sigma is correctly set in fvSolution. Since sigma is a tensor, maybe a smoothSolver with symGaussSeidel.\n\nAnother thing to verify: in the Maxwell model, the constitutive equation might require solving a transport equation for sigma, which would necessitate the appropriate fvSchemes and fvSolution entries.\n\nAfter validating all these points, structure the JSON response with each file's content as a string, ensuring that FoamFile headers are included but the OpenFOAM banner comments are omitted. Make sure keys are the file paths, and values are the file contents without markdown syntax.\n",
