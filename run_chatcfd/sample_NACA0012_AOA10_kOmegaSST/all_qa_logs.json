    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to convert a JSON string into a specific Markdown format. The main points are: each top-level key becomes a main heading with #, and the key-value pairs under it are unordered list items. Also, the hierarchy should be maintained.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the given JSON. The example provided has \"Case_1\" as the top-level key. Under that, there are several keys like case_name, solver, turbulence_model, etc. Each of these should be list items under the main heading.\n\nWait, the third point says to maintain the original key-value hierarchy in list format. So if there's a nested structure, like if a value is another object, that should be handled with sub-lists. But in the provided JSON, the values under Case_1 are all strings, not nested objects. So maybe in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nLet me check the example. The user gave a JSON where each key under Case_1 is a single level. So the Markdown would start with # Case_1, then each key-value pair as a bullet point. For example:\n\n- case_name: NACA0012_AOA10_kOmegaSST\n- solver: simpleFoam\n... and so on.\n\nSo the steps are: take each top-level key (like Case_1), make it a main heading. Then for each key in that object, create a list item with the key and value separated by a colon.\n\nI need to ensure that the Markdown syntax is correct. The main heading uses #, then each list item starts with a hyphen. Also, the keys should be in lowercase with underscores, but the user probably wants to keep the original formatting. So case_name remains as is.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input, the keys under Case_1 are case_name, solver, etc. So in the Markdown, each of these becomes an item. The example output the user provided in their answer shows exactly that.\n\nSo the conversion is straightforward. For each top-level key, create a heading. Then list each sub-key as a bullet point with key: value.\n\nNo nesting beyond that in the example, so perhaps the structure is flat. But if there were deeper nesting, like if a value was another object, we might need sub-lists. However, the user's example doesn't require that, so maybe the current approach is sufficient.\n\nTesting this with the given JSON:\n\nThe main heading is # Case_1. Then each key under Case_1 becomes a list item. So:\n\n- case_name: NACA0012_AOA10_kOmegaSST\n- solver: simpleFoam\n- turbulence_model: kOmegaSST\n- other_physical_model: none\n- case_specific_description: [long text]\n\nYes, that's what the user's example answer shows. So I just need to follow that structure.\n\nI should also check if there are any special characters in the values that need escaping in Markdown, but the given example doesn't have any. The case_specific_description has parentheses and slashes, but those are fine in Markdown.\n\nSo the final Markdown would look like the example provided. That's the correct approach.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results. Still, it is more in line with\\nthe experimental value. At an angle of attack of less than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is more consistent with the experimental value. Still, the lift coefficient obtained by the\\nnew turbulence model is less different from the experimental value, which suggests that the new\\nturbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift characteristics.\\nPage 10:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 8: Lift coefficient of NACA0012 airfoil\\n4. Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me try to figure out the boundary conditions from the paper and correct any spelling mistakes based on the OpenFOAM boundary list provided. \n\nFirst, looking at the paper's Table 1 in the boundary conditions section. The boundaries mentioned are Airfoil, Inlet/outlet, Front and back. The fields are U, p, nuTilda, and nut. \n\nThe Airfoil is a solid wall, so for OpenFOAM, the boundary type should be no-slip. The paper mentions \"no-slip adiabatic condition\" for the airfoil. Checking the OpenFOAM list, \"noSlip\" is a valid boundary condition. So Airfoil's U would be \"fixedValue\" (but wait, the table says 'fixed-value' for U on Airfoil. But in OpenFOAM, no-slip walls typically use \"noSlip\" for U, which automatically sets the velocity to zero. However, the table says 'fixed-value', which might be a mistake. Wait, the paper's Table 1 says for the Airfoil, U is fixed-value, which might be a typo. Because in OpenFOAM, walls with no-slip usually use \"noSlip\" which is a type of boundary condition, not fixedValue. But the user said to correct only spelling, not boundary types. Wait, the user said to validate against the OpenFOAM boundary names and correct spelling, but not change the boundary type. So if the paper says 'fixed-value', that's probably a typo for 'fixedValue', which is correct. But for the Airfoil's U, in OpenFOAM, if it's a no-slip wall, it's typically 'noSlip' or 'fixedValue' with a value of (0 0 0). The paper's table lists U for Airfoil as 'fixed-value', which is likely a typo for 'fixedValue'. Similarly, for nut on the Airfoil, the paper uses 'nutLowReWallFunction', which is in the OpenFOAM list as 'nutLowReWallFunction'. So that's correct.\n\nNext, Inlet/outlet boundaries. The paper mentions Inlet/outlet as a single boundary, but the user said to split any boundaries with slashes into separate ones. So Inlet and Outlet are separate. The fields here are U, p, nuTilda, nut. For Inlet, U is set to 'freestreamVelocity' which is a valid OpenFOAM BC (from the list). p is 'freestreamPressure', also valid. nuTilda is 'freestream' (from the list). nut is 'freestream' as well. For Outlet, U would be 'inletOutlet' or 'zeroGradient'? The paper says 'freestream' for U at inlet/outlet. Wait, the table in the paper says Inlet/outlet for U is 'freestream velocity' and 'freestreamPressure'. But in OpenFOAM, for outlet, pressure might be 'fixedValue' with a value or 'zeroGradient'. Wait, the user provided a list, and 'freestreamPressure' is a valid BC. But for outlet, typically pressure is set to zero gradient or fixedValue. However, the paper's table says Inlet/outlet uses 'freestreamPressure' for p. But according to the OpenFOAM list, 'freestreamPressure' is a valid BC. So perhaps the outlet uses 'freestreamPressure' as well. However, the user said to split Inlet/outlet into Inlet and Outlet. So Inlet would have U as 'freestreamVelocity', p as 'freestreamPressure', and Outlet would have U as 'inletOutlet' or 'freestream'? Wait, the paper's Table 1 says for Inlet/outlet, U is 'freestream velocity', which in OpenFOAM is 'freestreamVelocity'. But 'freestreamVelocity' is an inlet BC. For outlet, perhaps the correct BC is 'inletOutlet' or 'zeroGradient'. However, according to the user instruction, we must not change the boundary type except for spelling. The paper's original BC for Inlet/outlet U is 'freestream velocity', which is a typo for 'freestreamVelocity'. So splitting into Inlet and Outlet, perhaps Inlet uses 'freestreamVelocity' and Outlet uses 'freestreamVelocity' as well? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the Inlet is 'freestreamVelocity' and Outlet is 'zeroGradient' or 'inletOutlet'. But the user said to only correct spelling, not change the type. The paper's original entry for Inlet/outlet U is 'freestream velocity', which is a typo for 'freestreamVelocity', so Inlet and Outlet both would have U as 'freestreamVelocity'? But that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe the outlet uses 'pressureInletOutletVelocity' or something else. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, the user's instruction says to split boundaries with a slash into separate ones. So Inlet and Outlet are separate. The original paper's table lists Inlet/outlet for U as 'freestream velocity', which should be 'freestreamVelocity'. So for Inlet, U is 'freestreamVelocity', and for Outlet, maybe 'freestreamVelocity' as well? But that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the outlet uses 'inletOutlet' or 'zeroGradient'. But according to the user's instruction, we can't change the type, only correct spelling. So if the paper says Inlet/outlet uses 'freestream velocity' for U, then after splitting, Inlet's U is 'freestreamVelocity' and Outlet's U is 'freestreamVelocity'? But that's not standard. Maybe the paper intended Inlet to be 'freestreamVelocity' and Outlet to be 'zeroGradient' or 'inletOutlet', but the user's instruction says to only correct spelling. Alternatively, perhaps the original entry for Inlet/outlet in the paper's table is a mistake, and the correct BC for Outlet's U is 'empty' as per the table. Wait, looking back at the paper's Table 1, the Front and back boundaries are 'empty'. The Inlet/outlet boundaries have U as 'freestream velocity', p as 'freestreamPressure', nuTilda as 'freestream', and nut as 'freestream'. The Front and back are 'empty'. So splitting Inlet and Outlet, each would have their own BC. But the paper's table doesn't differentiate between Inlet and Outlet, which complicates things. Maybe the Inlet is 'freestreamVelocity' and the Outlet is 'freestreamPressure' for p, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the Inlet and Outlet are both using 'freestream' BCs. But in OpenFOAM, 'freestream' is a BC for certain fields. Alternatively, maybe the Inlet is 'fixedValue' with a freestream value, and the Outlet is 'zeroGradient'. But the user says to only correct spelling, not change the BC type. Since the paper's table says Inlet/outlet for U is 'freestream velocity', which is a typo for 'freestreamVelocity', so Inlet's U is 'freestreamVelocity', and Outlet's U is 'freestreamVelocity' as well. But that's unusual. Alternatively, maybe the outlet uses 'inletOutlet' which is a mixed BC. But according to the user's instruction, we can't change the type. So I'll proceed with the corrected spelling as per the paper's table.\n\nFor the 'Front and back' boundaries, the paper lists them as 'empty', which is a valid OpenFOAM BC.\n\nNow, the fields to consider are U, p, nut, and nuTilda. The user also mentioned fields like 'k' and 'omega', but the paper's table doesn't mention those, so maybe they're not applicable here.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Airfoil (wall):\n  - U: fixedValue (corrected from 'fixed-value')\n  - p: zeroGradient (as per the table)\n  - nuTilda: fixedValue (corrected from 'fixed-value')\n  - nut: nutLowReWallFunction (corrected from 'nutLowReWallFunction' as in the OpenFOAM list)\n\nWait, the paper's table says for Airfoil's U: fixed-value, which is 'fixedValue' in OpenFOAM. But for a no-slip wall, typically 'noSlip' is used. However, the user said not to change the boundary type, only correct spelling. So 'fixed-value' becomes 'fixedValue'. Similarly, for nut, the paper says 'nutLowReWallFunction', which is correct as per the OpenFOAM list.\n\nInlet:\n- U: freestreamVelocity (corrected from 'freestream velocity')\n- p: freestreamPressure\n- nuTilda: freestream\n- nut: freestream\n\nOutlet:\n- U: freestreamVelocity (since the paper's Inlet/outlet is split into Inlet and Outlet, but the original BC for U is 'freestream velocity', which is corrected to 'freestreamVelocity' for both? But that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe the outlet uses 'inletOutlet' or 'zeroGradient', but according to the user's instruction, we can't change the type. This is a problem. The paper's table says Inlet/outlet for U is 'freestream velocity', which is a single entry. When split into Inlet and Outlet, both would have the same BC? But in reality, the Inlet would have 'freestreamVelocity' and the Outlet might have 'zeroGradient' or 'inletOutlet'. However, the user's instruction is to only correct spelling, not change the BC type. So if the original entry is 'freestream velocity' for Inlet/outlet, after splitting, both Inlet and Outlet's U would be 'freestreamVelocity'. But that's incorrect for the outlet. However, the user's instruction says to only correct spelling, so perhaps that's the case.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentioned that when boundaries include a slash, they should be split. So Inlet and Outlet are separate. The original paper's table lists Inlet/outlet for U as 'freestream velocity', which is a typo for 'freestreamVelocity'. So both Inlet and Outlet's U would be 'freestreamVelocity'. Similarly, p is 'freestreamPressure' for both. But that's not typical. Usually, the outlet would have a different pressure BC. However, the user's instruction is to stick to the paper's described BCs, correcting only spelling. So proceeding with that.\n\nFront and back (empty):\n- All fields: empty\n\nSo the corrected BCs would be:\n\nFor Airfoil (boundary type: wall):\n- U: fixedValue\n- p: zeroGradient\n- nuTilda: fixedValue\n- nut: nutLowReWallFunction\n\nFor Inlet:\n- U: freestreamVelocity\n- p: freestreamPressure\n- nuTilda: freestream\n- nut: freestream\n\nFor Outlet:\n- U: freestreamVelocity\n- p: freestreamPressure\n- nuTilda: freestream\n- nut: freestream\n\nBut wait, in OpenFOAM, for an outlet, typically the pressure is set to a fixedValue (e.g., 0) or zeroGradient. However, according to the paper's table, it's 'freestreamPressure', which is a valid BC. So we'll keep it as is.\n\nFront and back:\n- All fields: empty\n\nNow, checking against the OpenFOAM boundary list to ensure spelling is correct:\n\n- fixedValue: correct\n- zeroGradient: correct\n- freestreamVelocity: present in the list as 'freestreamVelocity'\n- freestreamPressure: present as 'freestreamPressure'\n- freestream: present\n- nutLowReWallFunction: present as 'nutLowReWallFunction'\n- empty: correct\n\nSo the final JSON would list the boundaries for airfoil, inlet, outlet, and ensure the fields have the corrected BC names.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14].

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model.

The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to simulate the NACA0012 airfoil case using OpenFOAM-v2406 with specific boundary conditions based on the research paper provided. The boundary conditions are given in a JSON format, and I need to extract the necessary parameters from the paper to fill in the values.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the flow conditions mentioned in the paper. The problem is a steady-state RANS simulation at Mach 0.15, Reynolds number 6e6, and 10-degree angle of attack. The turbulence model mentioned in the user's case is kOmegaSST, but the paper uses the S-A model and a new model. However, the boundary conditions provided in the JSON structure include fields like nuTilda and nut, which are specific to the S-A model. Wait, the user's case uses kOmegaSST, but the boundary conditions here might still require similar setup. Hmm, maybe the user is adapting the paper's setup but with a different turbulence model. But the JSON structure provided has nuTilda and nut, which are part of the S-A model. The kOmegaSST uses k and omega instead. This might be a discrepancy. But the user insists on not changing the boundary types, so I have to stick with the given JSON structure, even if it's for a different model. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow their instructions.\n\nNext, the paper mentions the boundary conditions in Table 1. For the airfoil (wall), U is fixedValue, p is zeroGradient, nuTilda is fixedValue, and nut is nutLowReWallFunction. For inlet/outlet, U is freestreamVelocity, p is freestreamPressure, nuTilda and nut are freestream. The initial conditions should be uniform flow based on the inflow conditions.\n\nThe Mach number is 0.15, and the ambient temperature is 300 K. The Reynolds number is 6e6 based on chord length (c=1m). The fluid is air, so I need to calculate the kinematic viscosity (nu) using Re = U*c/nu. Let's compute U first. Since Ma = U/c_sound, and c_sound for air is sqrt(gamma*R*T). Gamma for air is 1.4, R is 287 J/kg·K. So c_sound = sqrt(1.4*287*300) ≈ 347.2 m/s. Then U = Ma * c_sound = 0.15 * 347.2 ≈ 52.08 m/s. Now, Re = 6e6 = (U * c)/nu → nu = (52.08 * 1)/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s. But wait, the kinematic viscosity of air at 300 K is approximately 1.5e-5 m²/s. Hmm, this discrepancy suggests that maybe the chord length isn't 1m, but the paper uses dimensionless chord length c=1.0. Maybe the actual chord length is different. Wait, the Reynolds number in the paper is based on chord length and inflow conditions. Let me check again. The paper states: \"Reynolds number of 6×10^6 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature of 300 K.\" So Re = (U * c)/nu = 6e6. If c is 1m (as per the dimensionless setup), then U = 52.08 m/s, and nu = (52.08 * 1)/6e6 ≈ 8.68e-6 m²/s. But at 300 K, the kinematic viscosity of air is around 1.568e-5 m²/s. This suggests that either the chord length is not 1m or there's a different reference. Wait, maybe the chord length is not 1m in reality. Let's recalculate. Let's assume the chord length is such that Re=6e6. Using standard air properties at 300 K: nu_air ≈ 1.568e-5 m²/s. Then Re = (U * c)/nu_air = 6e6. If U is 52.08 m/s (from Mach 0.15), then c = (Re * nu_air)/U = (6e6 * 1.568e-5)/52.08 ≈ (94080)/52.08 ≈ 1806 m. That's not possible. Therefore, there must be an error here. Alternatively, maybe the paper uses a different reference velocity or the chord length is not 1m. Wait, the paper says \"the chord length (characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0\". So it's dimensionless. Therefore, the actual physical chord length isn't 1m, but the Reynolds number is calculated with c=1. Maybe the user is using a real chord length, but the problem is to set up the case in OpenFOAM with dimensional units. Hmm, this is confusing. Let's proceed with the given data.\n\nThe user wants to set up the case with the given boundary conditions. The initial fields need to be uniform. For U, it's the freestream velocity. The direction depends on the angle of attack. At 10 degrees, the velocity components would be Ux = U * cos(10°) and Uy = U * sin(10°). But the paper uses a structured grid, and the angle of attack is set by rotating the airfoil or the inflow direction. In OpenFOAM, typically, the flow direction is adjusted via the velocity vector.\n\nThe pressure is calculated based on the incompressible assumption. Since it's incompressible, the pressure field's initial value can be set to a reference value, like 0, but in OpenFOAM, for incompressible solvers, pressure is often normalized by density. Wait, the paper uses incompressible N-S equations. So, the pressure is in kinematic form (p/rho). The freestreamPressure would be 0 if using gauge pressure. Alternatively, the freestreamPressure could be set based on the dynamic pressure. Wait, in OpenFOAM's freestreamPressure boundary condition, it's usually set to 0 for incompressible flows, as the pressure is relative. But the exact value might depend on the solver setup. The paper mentions using the SIMPLE/SIMPLEC algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling.\n\nFor turbulence fields, nuTilda is the modified viscosity for the S-A model. However, the user is using kOmegaSST, which doesn't use nuTilda. But the JSON structure provided includes nuTilda, which suggests that the user might have a mistake here. But the user insists not to change the boundary types. Therefore, I have to proceed with the given structure, even if it's not matching the turbulence model. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to use the S-A model but mentioned kOmegaSST by mistake. But regardless, I have to follow the given JSON structure.\n\nThe nut (turbulent viscosity) boundary condition for the airfoil is nutLowReWallFunction, which enforces a wall function for low Reynolds number flows. The inlet and outlet have nut set to freestream, which would be the turbulent viscosity in the freestream. For the S-A model, the freestream value of nuTilda is typically set to a small value, like 0.1*nu_lam or similar. But according to the paper's setup, the initial calculation field is the uniform flow under incoming flow conditions. The paper uses the S-A model, so nuTilda's freestream value would be based on the turbulence model's requirements.\n\nIn the paper's Table 1, the boundary conditions for nuTilda and nut are set as freestream for inlet/outlet. The initial values would be uniform, so for nuTilda, perhaps 3*nu_lam (a common practice for S-A model initialization). But the exact value needs to be calculated. Alternatively, if the turbulence intensity is low, the freestream turbulence viscosity would be small. Let's calculate nuTilda (which is the modified viscosity in the S-A model). The freestream value for nuTilda in the S-A model is typically set to between 0.1 and 10 times the molecular viscosity, depending on the turbulence level. Assuming low turbulence intensity, maybe 5*nu. Given nu is 8.68e-6 m²/s (from earlier calculation), then nuTilda would be 5*8.68e-6 ≈ 4.34e-5 m²/s. But this is a rough estimate. Alternatively, the paper might specify the freestream turbulence properties, but I don't see that in the excerpts provided. So, I have to make an assumption here.\n\nFor nut (turbulent viscosity), in the freestream, it's usually set to a small value, perhaps 1e-5 m²/s, but again, without specific data, I'll have to proceed with the information given. Wait, in the paper's case, the initial field is uniform flow, so the initial nut would be calculated based on the turbulence model's freestream conditions. Since the user's case uses kOmegaSST, but the boundary conditions are for S-A, there's a conflict. However, the user provided the JSON structure, so I must follow it, even if it's for a different model.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Airfoil (wall):\n  - U: fixedValue (0 0 0) (no-slip)\n  - p: zeroGradient\n  - nuTilda: fixedValue (calculated freestream value)\n  - nut: nutLowReWallFunction\n\n- Inlet/outlet:\n  - U: freestreamVelocity (52.08 m/s at 10° AoA)\n  - p: freestreamPressure (0)\n  - nuTilda: freestream (value as calculated)\n  - nut: freestream (value as calculated)\n\nThe initial conditions would set all fields uniformly. U is (Ux, Uy, 0) based on AoA. For 10 degrees, Ux = U*cos(10°), Uy = U*sin(10°). U magnitude is 52.08 m/s. So Ux ≈ 52.08 * cos(10°) ≈ 51.3 m/s, Uy ≈ 52.08 * sin(10°) ≈ 9.05 m/s. So initial U is (51.3, 9.05, 0). Pressure is initialized to 0 (assuming gauge). nuTilda is initialized to the freestream value (e.g., 4.34e-5), and nut initialized to the same freestream value (but for kOmegaSST, this would be different, but per the user's structure, we proceed).\n\nWait, but the user's case uses kOmegaSST, which doesn't use nuTilda. This is conflicting. However, the user provided the boundary conditions with nuTilda and nut, so perhaps they intended to use the S-A model but mentioned kOmegaSST by mistake. Alternatively, they might have a typo. But the user insists not to change the boundary types. Therefore, proceed with the given structure, even if it's for a different turbulence model.\n\nIn conclusion, the JSON should reflect the initial and boundary conditions based on the paper's parameters, converted into the required fields. The values are calculated using the given Mach number, Reynolds number, and temperature.\n",

Due to the need to evaluate the applicability of the new turbulence model\\nin the numerical calculation, the flow around the NACA0012 airfoil with a Mach number of 0.15\\nand multiple angles of attack was calculated on the OpenFOAM calculation platform based on\\ngrid independence research. The Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model and the newly proposed\\nturbulence model were adopted. The surface pressure and lift coefficients of the NACA0012\\nairfoil were calculated and compared with the experimental data. It was revealed that the two\\nmodels simulated the flow around the airfoil well, and the S-A model was slightly better for\\ncalculating the airfoil pressure coefficient. The new turbulence model was more accurate for\\ncalculating the lift coefficient, thus illustrating the preliminary applicability of the new model to\\nthe low-speed flow around the airfoil.\\n1. Introduction\\nIn recent years, with the dramatic increase in computer computing power, computational fluid\\ndynamics has been widely applied in aerospace, automotive design, chemical design, etc., and\\nnumerical simulation techniques have also received attention from many countries worldwide. For\\nexample, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed and released the\\n\"Computational Fluid Dynamics Vision 2030\" planning document, and NASA reached a consensus\\nwith US government agencies to conduct research in six fields, including supersonic combustion and\\nboundary layer flow mechanism [1-3]. Moreover, there are varying influencing factors such as\\ngeometric shape, mesh distribution, physical model, and numerical calculation method when the\\nnumerical simulation is carried out for more complex engineering projects. The numerical calculation\\nmethod is of particular interest to scholars. Flow around the airfoil is one of the common problems in\\nengineering practice, such as aircraft takeoff and landing, numerical simulation of multi-stage\\ncompressors and multi-stage turbines, etc. The study of airfoil boundary layer fluid is conducive to\\nimproving the control method of fluid flow and designing a better aerodynamic shape. Therefore, the\\nstudy of flow around airfoils exhibits important engineering application value.\\nBased on the RANS method, Yan Wenhui et al. [4-5] applied the elliptical equation mesh method\\nproposed by Hilgenstock to generate a structured mesh and numerically simulated NACA4412 airfoil.\\nPage 3:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nThe Gao-Yong turbulence model was more suitable for simulating the wake relaxation effect of flow\\naround an airfoil. The unsteady time-averaged calculation results were superior to the steady\\ncalculation values. Qiu Fusheng et al. [6] numerically calculated the wing of a light sports aircraft\\nbased on the MDR turbulence model. They concluded that compared to the standard turbulence model,\\nthe κ-ε turbulence model with dissipation rate correction could better simulate the flow around an\\nairfoil in the wake region. Yang Yuxiao et al. [7] simulated the cavitation of sheet clouds around the\\nhydrofoil using static and adaptive mesh techniques and analyzed the causes of cavitation shedding. It\\nwas noted that the adaptive mesh could better balance the mesh resolution and computational\\ncomplexity. The interaction of vortices and vacuoles formed on the upper surface behind the hydrofoil\\nwas very obvious. Based on the dynamic grid technique, Qian Yu et al. [8] investigated the dynamic\\nstall of NACA0012 airfoil in unsteady flow. They demonstrated that dynamic mesh technology and the\\nSST turbulence model could well capture the dynamic stall process of the airfoil through numerical\\ncalculations and comparison of experimental results. Based on the non-embedded PC (polynomial\\nchaos) expansion method, Zhao Hui [9] et al. adopted the S-A model to simulate the RAE2822\\ntransonic airfoil numerically and investigated the effect of the uncertainties of the nine parameters of\\nthe S-A turbulence model on the numerical simulations, and demonstrated that the established PC\\nexpansion could accurately illustrate the response of the output to the input by comparing the PC\\nexpansion with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. Based on the one-equation S-A\\nmodel, two-equation Realizable model, and SST model in vortex viscosity model, Gu Running et al.\\n[10] numerically simulated NACA0012 airfoil at different angles of attack and different Mach\\nnumbers and verified the accuracy of the three turbulence models for simulating high Mach number\\nflow by comparing with wind tunnel experiments. Xue Yangliu et al. [11] applied the SDES method to\\nnumerically simulate the unsteady turbulent flow of a dynamic airfoil stall. They compared it with the\\nDDES method and wind tunnel experimental results to provide a new RANS/LES method for\\nnumerical simulation of airfoil aerodynamics. ZHANG et al. [12] explored the low-speed flow around\\nthe S809 wing by combining the experimental data with numerical simulation and experimental\\nobservations. The improved data assimilation technique could accurately exhibit complex turbulence\\nfield problems such as wing flow.\\nThis paper adopted the open-source software OpenFOAM to model the new model obtained by\\ngrouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity. Additionally, the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model\\nand the new model were applied to numerically calculate the low-speed flow around the NACA0012\\nairfoil, with the simulated angle of attack of 0-15° and the inflow Mach number of 0.15, the Reynolds\\nnumber of 6×106 based on the airfoil chord length and inflow conditions, and the ambient temperature\\nof 300 K. The eddy current changes on the upper and lower sides of the wing, especially at the trailing\\nedge, could be observed under these conditions. This paper adopted two turbulence models to simulate\\nthe NACA0012 airfoil numerically, and the surface pressure coefficient, lift coefficient, eddy current\\nfield, and streamlined distribution of the airfoil were obtained. Besides, the applicability of the new\\nturbulence model for the solution of the airfoil flow problem was also verified by comparing it with\\nthe experimental values in the literature [13].\\n2. Control Equations and Numerical Methods\\n2.1. Control equations and turbulence models\\nThe control equation used in this paper was the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Reynolds-averaged\\nincompressible form, and the continuity equation and momentum equation in the rectangular\\ncoordinate system is in the following differential forms:\\n( ) 1 1\\n( + ) i i turb\\nj ij ij\\n∂ ∂ ∂ ∂\\n+ =− +\\n∂ ∂ ρ∂ ρ∂\\nx x x\\nσ σ (2)\\nPage 4:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nWherein, ρ represents density, p means pressure,\\nu represents velocity,\\nσ represents laminar\\nviscous stress, and turb\\nσ indicates turbulent viscous stress. The new turbulence model in this paper was\\nconstructed based on the group average of turbulent fluctuation velocity. The instantaneous velocity of\\nturbulence can be expressed as = + ′ u u u , where u it means the average ensemble velocity and ′ u\\nmeans the corresponding fluctuation velocity. Since the ensemble average of all fluctuation velocities\\nat a point in space is 0, using the first-order fluctuation velocity\\nu in the turbulence modeling process\\nis impossible, which is physically real and plays an important role. As a result, the positive and\\nnegative groups based on the mean value were grouped and weighted to obtain the mean information\\nof the non-zero first-order fluctuation velocity, as described in the literature [14]. The specific\\nturbulence model equations are illustrated below.\\nThe fluctuation continuity equation is:\\nThe group average fluctuation velocity equation is:\\n( ) ( )\\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ 1 Turb Turb\\nj j i i j ij ij ij ij ij\\n∂ ∂ + + ∂ + − −\\n∂ ∂ ∂\\nσ σ σ σ u u u uu\\nWherein ˆ\\nu represents the group average fluctuation velocity and ˆ\\nσ the laminar stress\\ncorresponding to the fluctuation velocity after the group average, similar to the calculation\\nσ ˆ Turb\\nσ .

Numerical methods, meshes, and boundary conditions\\nThis paper adopted the OpenFOAM platform to model the new turbulence model. A simple foam\\nsolver using the finite volume method was used to solve the N-S equation of steady-state\\nincompressible Newtonian fluid. The coupling of pressure and velocity was calculated via\\nSIMPLE/SIMPLEC to ensure the accuracy and stability of the calculation.\\nIn this paper, with NACA0012 airfoil flow as the research object, the S-A model and new\\nturbulence model, after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity, were applied to\\nnumerically simulate the flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number. The differences between the\\ntwo turbulence models for simulating flow around an airfoil at a low Mach number were compared.\\nThe computational domain of the NACA0012 airfoil is shown in Figure 1, and the chord length\\n(characteristic length) of a dimensionless airfoil is c = 1.0. Further, to reduce the influence of the far\\nfield on the calculation result, the outer boundary of the computational domain is about 500 c, away\\nfrom each direction. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the extruded C-type structured grid provided in the\\nliterature [16-17] is used as a computational grid in this paper to locally encrypt the front and tail\\nedges of the airfoil. To verify the grid independence, three sets of grids with mesh numbers of 449×49,\\n897×257 and 1793×513were calculated, respectively, and it was found that the results of the other two\\nsets of meshes were consistent except that the boundary layer of the first set of meshes was not\\nencrypted sufficiently. The pressure coefficients (C\\n) of the airfoil surface calculated using the S-A\\nmodel on two sets of grids, 897 ×257 and 1793 × 513, shown in Figure 4, and it can be observed that\\nPage 5:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nthe results of these two sets of grids are coincident. This paper used the structured mesh of 897×257\\nfor subsequent calculation, with the airfoil wall y + <1.0.\\nFigure 1: Computational domain of NACA0012 airfoil\\nFigure 2: Computational domain grid\\nFigure 3: Computational grid near NACA0012 airfoil Figure\\nPage 6:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\nFigure 4: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient\\nThe boundary conditions are inlet boundary, outlet boundary, solid wall boundary, and empty\\nboundary.

Comparative Analysis of Calculated Results\\nThe calculated airfoil surface pressure coefficient and the experimental values of the two turbulence\\nmodels at angles of attack of 0°, 6.03°, 10°, and 15° are shown in Figures 5(a)-5(d) respectively (the\\nexperiment at 6.03° angle of attack was not performed in the literature [13]). The new turbulence\\nmodel obtained after grouping the average turbulent fluctuation velocity and the S-A turbulence model\\ncould more accurately simulate the airfoil surface pressure coefficient. Still, there are differences\\nbetween these two models in some aspects. The surface pressure number obtained using the new\\nmodel at a small part of the trailing edge is larger than the experimental value, but the deviation is\\nsmall. Besides, the S-A model can calculate the pressure coefficients on the airfoil surface better than\\nthe new turbulence model when the airfoil is close to the stall state with the gradual increase of the\\nhead angle.\\nPage 7:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) 0° angle of attack\\n(b) 6.03° angle of attack\\n(c) 10° angle of attack\\nPage 8:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(d) 15° angle of attack\\nFigure 5: NACA0012 airfoil surface pressure coefficient at a different angle of attack\\nThe vortex diagrams of the two models at different angles of attack are illustrated in Figure 6, and\\nit can be seen that the diagrams that both models can better simulate the process of airfoil development\\nfrom stable flow to dynamic stall with the increase of angle of attack. The laminar flow is attached to\\nthe surface of the airfoil at the angle of attack of 0°. From the figure, it can be observed that the new\\nturbulence model is more stable than the S-A model. At the angle of attack of 15°, as shown in the\\nfigure, the vortex cloud diagram of the S-A model is more stable than that of the new turbulence\\nmodel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) are the streamlined diagrams of the two models at the NACA0012 airfoil\\nat an attack angle of attack of 15°. The comparison revealed that the results obtained using the two\\nturbulence models are consistent around the entire airfoil, indicating that the new turbulence model\\ncan better simulate the flow field at low speed.\\nFigure 6: Vortex cloud diagram of NACA0012 airfoil\\nPage 9:\\nAAME 2023\\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 2569\\nIOP Publishing\\n(2023) 012075 doi:10.1088/1742-6596/2569/1/012075\\n(a) Streamlines for S-A model calculation\\n(b) Streamlines for new model calculation\\nFigure 7: Comparison of Streamline diagrams for the two turbulence model\\nThe airfoil lift coefficients (\\nC ) calculated using two turbulence models are compared with the\\nexperimental data in Figure 8, and the abscissa\\nmeans the airfoil\\'s angle of attack. According to the\\ndiagram, the lift coefficients calculated using the new and S-A turbulence models are consistent with\\nthe experimental data. At the angle of attack of more than 8 °, the lift coefficient calculated using the\\nS-A model is significantly smaller than the experimental value, and the lift coefficient obtained using\\nthe new turbulence model is slightly larger than the experimental results.

Conclusions\\nThis paper takes the low-speed flow of NACA0012 airfoil as the research object. Based on the\\nOpenFOAM calculation platform, the new and S-A turbulence models obtained after grouping the\\naverage turbulent fluctuation velocity were adopted to simulate the flow numerically. Also, the airfoil\\'s\\nsurface pressure coefficient and lift coefficient were compared. The following conclusions are\\nobtained:\\n(1) Generally, the results calculated using both turbulence models agree with the experimental data\\nand can meet the application requirements in engineering practice. For calculating the airfoil surface\\npressure coefficient, the S-A model is slightly better than the new turbulence model, especially at the\\nairfoil trailing edge and a large angle of attack.\\n(2)The two turbulence models obtain similar calculation results for the vorticity of the flow field.\\nStill, the S-A model is superior to the new turbulence model at a large angle of attack.\\n(3)The airfoil lift coefficients calculated using both the new turbulence model and the S-A model\\ndiffer from the experimental values to some extent. Still, the results calculated using the new\\nturbulence model are more accurate and closer to the experimental values, especially at the angle of\\nattack of more than 8°. The new turbulence model possesses better prediction of airfoil lift\\ncharacteristics.\\nReferences\\n[1] H. Y. Sun, Z. X. Sun, X. L. Chen, et al.

    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to set up an OpenFOAM case for simulating the NACA0012 airfoil using simpleFoam and the k-omega SST model. They provided specific initial and boundary conditions in JSON format, and they want all the necessary case files in a JSON response without any markdown or extra text.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure of an OpenFOAM case. The main directories are 0, system, and constant. Each contains specific files. For a RANS simulation with k-omega SST, the 0 directory should include U, p, k, omega, and nut. The system directory needs controlDict, fvSchemes, and fvSolution. The constant directory requires turbulenceProperties and transportProperties.\n\nLooking at the initial conditions: U is [51.3, 9.05, 0], which is the freestream velocity at a 10-degree angle of attack (since tan⁻¹(9.05/51.3) ≈ 10°). The pressure is 0, which makes sense for incompressible flow. nuTilda and nut are both 4.34e-5. Wait, nuTilda is specific to the Spalart-Allmaras model, but the user wants kOmegaSST. Oh, but the user's initial JSON includes nuTilda, which might be a mistake. However, the user specified to strictly follow the provided conditions, so I'll include it even though it's not used in k-omega SST. Maybe they have a typo, but I have to follow their instructions.\n\nBoundary conditions: The airfoil uses fixedValue U of [0,0,0] (no-slip), zeroGradient for p, fixedValue 0 for nuTilda, and nutLowReWallFunction for nut. Inlet and outlet use freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. But wait, in OpenFOAM, for incompressible solvers like simpleFoam, the inlet often uses fixedValue for U and zeroGradient for p, but the user specified freestreamVelocity and freestreamPressure. I need to check if these boundary types exist. Freestream conditions are typically used in potentialFoam or for outlets, but maybe the user has a specific setup. I'll follow their instructions strictly.\n\nFor turbulenceProperties, the RAS model should be kOmegaSST. The transportProperties should have nu (kinematic viscosity), which can be calculated from Re=6e6, chord length 1m, velocity ~51.3 m/s (since Re = velocity * chord / nu → nu = 51.3 * 1 / 6e6 ≈ 8.55e-6 m²/s). Wait, the user's initial condition has nuTilda as 4.34e-5, which is higher than this. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy. But the user provided nuTilda and nut as 4.34e-5, which might be the turbulent viscosity. However, in k-omega SST, nut is calculated from k and omega. But initial conditions for k and omega need to be set. The user's initial JSON doesn't mention k and omega, but their case files list 0/k and 0/omega. So I need to set initial values for those. The user's provided initial conditions don't specify k and omega, so I need to infer reasonable values. For k, maybe based on turbulence intensity. Let's say 0.1% turbulence intensity: k = 1.5*(U*I)^2 = 1.5*(51.3*0.001)^2 ≈ 0.004. Omega can be estimated using omega = k/(nu*Cmu), but Cmu for SST is 0.09? So omega ≈ 0.004 / (8.55e-6 * 0.09) ≈ 5180. But the user's initial conditions might have different values. Wait, the user didn't provide initial k and omega in their JSON, but the files are required. So perhaps the user expects default values, but since the initial JSON doesn't specify, I'll have to make assumptions. However, the user provided initial conditions for U, p, nuTilda, and nut, but not for k and omega. So in the 0/k and 0/omega files, I need to set internalField and boundary conditions. Maybe set k to a small value like 0.001 and omega to 1000, but need to check the boundary conditions for these fields.\n\nThe turbulenceProperties file should have RASModel as kOmegaSST. The transportProperties needs nu, which is the kinematic viscosity. Using Re=6e6, U=51.3, chord=1m, nu = U*L/Re = 51.3*1/6e6 ≈ 8.55e-6 m²/s. But the user's initial nuTilda is 4.34e-5, which is higher. Maybe they have a different approach, but I'll proceed with the calculated nu.\n\nNow, constructing each file:\n\n0/U: Internal field as [51.3 9.05 0]. Boundaries: airfoil as fixedValue [0 0 0], inlet as freestreamVelocity with same value, outlet same as inlet, front/back as empty.\n\n0/p: Internal 0, zeroGradient on airfoil, freestreamPressure on inlet/outlet, empty elsewhere.\n\n0/k and 0/omega: Need to set initial values. For k, maybe internal 0.1, and inlet freestream with same. For omega, internal 1000. But the user didn't specify, so perhaps use reasonable defaults. The airfoil boundary for k is kqRWallFunction, omega is omegaWallFunction, and inlet/outlet as freestream.\n\n0/nut: Internal 4.34e-5, airfoil nutLowReWallFunction, inlet/outlet freestream.\n\n0/nuTilda: Even though kOmegaSST doesn't use it, the user's initial conditions include it, so it must be present. Set to 0 internally and on airfoil, freestream elsewhere.\n\nsystem/controlDict: application simpleFoam, startTime 0, endTime 2000, writeInterval 500, etc.\n\nsystem/fvSchemes: Default Gauss linear for gradients, div terms for RANS, laplacian schemes, interpolation linear, snGrad corrected.\n\nsystem/fvSolution: SIMPLE solver settings, relaxation factors, turbulence on.\n\nconstant/turbulenceProperties: RAS { model kOmegaSST; turbulence on; printCoeffs on; }\n\nconstant/transportProperties: nu [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 8.55e-06 (calculated from Re).\n\nNow, checking all boundaries are included as per user's JSON: airfoil, inlet, outlet, front/back as empty. The user mentioned \"front and back\" as empty in the boundary conditions, so in the U, p, etc., files, those patches should be type empty.\n\nWait, the user's JSON has \"front and back\" as empty, so in the OpenFOAM mesh, those are likely the front and back patches of a 2D mesh (assuming it's a 2D case extruded one cell thick). So in the boundary field, those patches should be type empty.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned using a structured C-grid (897x257 cells), which is 2D, so the front and back are empty.\n\nSo each 0 file (U, p, k, omega, nut, nuTilda) must have boundaries: airfoil, inlet, outlet, front, back, each with appropriate conditions.\n\nNow, putting it all together in JSON format, with each file's content as a string. The keys are the filenames, and the values are the file contents without the OpenFOAM header but including the FoamFile header.\n\nFor example, 0/U would have:\n\nFoamFile\n{\n    version     2.0;\n    format      ascii;\n    class       volVectorField;\n    object      U;\n}\n\ninternalField   uniform (51.3 9.05 0);\n\nboundaryField\n{\n    airfoil\n    {\n        type            fixedValue;\n        value           uniform (0 0 0);\n    }\n    inlet\n    {\n        type            freestreamVelocity;\n        freestreamValue uniform (51.3 9.05 0);\n    }\n    outlet\n    {\n        type            freestreamVelocity;\n        freestreamValue uniform (51.3 9.05 0);\n    }\n    front\n    {\n        type            empty;\n    }\n    back\n    {\n        type            empty;\n    }\n}\n\nAnd similarly for other files. For 0/k and 0/omega, the airfoil would use wall functions, and inlet/outlet freestream with appropriate values.\n\nWait, for kOmegaSST, the omega boundary condition on the wall is omegaWallFunction. For k, it's kqRWallFunction. The inlet and outlet would use freestream for k and omega, which in OpenFOAM might be inletOutlet or fixedValue. But the user's JSON specifies for inlet/outlet, k and omega would have freestream type. However, in OpenFOAM, the freestream condition for k and omega might not exist. Wait, the user's initial conditions mention for inlet/outlet, U is freestreamVelocity, p is freestreamPressure, and nut is freestream. But for k and omega, the user didn't specify, but in the files list, 0/k and 0/omega are required. So for k and omega, the inlet and outlet should use freestream conditions. However, OpenFOAM's freestream boundary condition is for potentialFoam. For RANS, typically, inlet uses fixedValue or inletOutlet. But the user's instructions say to strictly follow the provided JSON, which for k and omega isn't present. Wait, the user's JSON only specifies U, p, nuTilda, and nut. So for k and omega, the user might have forgotten to include them, but since they are required for kOmegaSST, I need to set them. Since the user didn't provide, I'll have to make reasonable assumptions. Maybe set k's freestream to a small value like 0.1 m²/s² and omega to 1000 1/s. But the exact values depend on the turbulence model and flow conditions. However, the user's case files include 0/k and 0/omega, so they must be included.\n\nPutting all this together, ensuring each file's FoamFile header is correct, and the boundary conditions match the user's JSON. Also, ensuring that the controlDict uses simpleFoam, and the fvSchemes and fvSolution are appropriate for a RANS simulation.\n\nFinally, validate that all files are present and correctly formatted, with no markdown, only JSON structure with keys as filenames and values as file contents.\n",

The error message points to line 9 in the file, but looking at the provided content, the file only has entries for 'nu' after the FoamFile header. The tutorials they referenced include a 'transportModel' entry, like 'Newtonian'. So, the problem is that their transportProperties file is missing the required 'transportModel' key.\n\nThe solution should add that entry without changing the existing 'nu' value. The user's initial and boundary conditions mention nuTilda and nut, which are part of the k-omega SST model. The transportModel in OpenFOAM for incompressible flows is typically 'Newtonian', so adding 'transportModel Newtonian;' before the 'nu' line makes sense. That way, the solver knows which viscosity model to use. They need to make sure not to alter the 'nu' value of 8.55e-06 to maintain the initial conditions. The corrected file should have both entries in the correct order. Let me check the sample files again to confirm the structure. Yes, the samples have transportModel first, then nu. So adding that line should fix the error.\n",
